                  Today I spent more time collecting resources and learning about NLP. In particular, today I started looking at resources about Neural Networks. I found an introductory Neural Networks tutorial on Youtube, which requires no prior knowledge. I started working through this course and plan to use this as my jumping-off point before diving into more advanced resources. I found other courses and articles about Neural Networks and NLP. In particular, I found entire courses from Stanford, one of which is about NLP specifically and another which is specifically about NLP with Deep Learning. I think that once I finish the introductory neural network course I will try the Stanford NLP with Deep Learning course, and if it is still too advanced to follow and I will go back to more basic courses. I also found a few more resources about NER. In particular, I started looking into the documentation for spaCy. I only have a basic overview, so I will go back later and read more of the details when it comes time to start building the tool.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today I also looked into some possible packages that I might use in the process of pre-processing the text,, such as BeautifulSoup and NLTK. I looked at the capabilities of these tools and how I might use them in practice. In the coming days, I will look into more packages for feature extraction and classification, since I anticipate that this will be the bulk of the work when it comes to being able to accurately classify the Spend data. In the past two days there has definitely been an overwhelming amount of new information, but writing it down here and trying to absorb it little by little has definitely been helping. :)
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today I also got to contact a few different groups of people. So while I am doing quite a bit of individual research, I am still able to reach out to Rajiv and other team members as well as other interns.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This morning Rajiv and I had our first weekly 1:1. During this time, I got to talk about my personal career aspirations and what I was hoping to gain from the internship. I talked about my experience working with front-end and back-end and how I was interested in ML and AI, but there didn’t seem to be many opportunities in ML for undergraduates. Rajiv offered some helpful insight about how fast the CS industry moves and how in 2 years when I graduate, ML might be much more prevalent and how job opportunities could very well open up for undergraduates like me. Rajiv also taught me about Cloud products, specifically SAS, and how they are integrated into Fidelity as well as our everyday lives. I enjoy learning about current relevant technologies used by Fidelity during these meetings with Rajiv. He also suggested that I come to more Scrum meetings so that I can learn more about the corporate workflow, specifically with Agile. I will definitely take him up on that offer and I plan to attend tomorrow’s Scrum meeting!
                </p>
                <p>
                  This afternoon, we had a meet-up with CTG leadership and interns. The meeting was pretty casual, and we went around introducing ourselves and having some conversations about the COVID-19 situation. It was nice to be able to meet the other interns that I might have been working alongside or even sharing office space with in Westlake. I connected with some interns on LinkedIn after the meeting and one intern reached out to me and we had a brief conversation about our projects. It’s cool to hear about other interns’ projects and have the “water cooler conversations” that we might have had back in the office. I also kept in touch with my mentor group throughout the day.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A couple of questions came up during my research from yesterday and this morning, so I messaged all the members of yesterday’s meeting. David responded very promptly and answered a lot of my questions and even gave me some sample data to look at! At first glance, the data is pretty overwhelming. I don’t fully understand it yet, but I will take a better look at it once I get more involved with the specifics of the project. Rajiv also informed me that Janice invited me to Thursday’s FPAIT staff meeting, where I will introduce myself. I have yet to receive the email invite, but I am looking forward to meeting even more people!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tomorrow I plan to continue my introductory neural network course and hopefully start the Stanford course. Additionally, Rajiv has set up a meeting for me to introduce myself to a member of the team from India after the morning Scrum meeting, which I am excited about. There is also a Fidtern workshop about professional branding that I hope to attend in the afternoon. Looking forward to another busy day of learning!

                  I spent most of my time today independently researching the more basic concepts of NLP. and the general workflow of data science. I found a particularly helpful video was this video from PyOhio about NLP in Python. The speaker was Alice Zhao and I found that the way she explained the concepts was very clear and approachable for someone like me who is new to NLP and Data Analytics as a whole. I spent most of my morning watching this lecture and taking some notes to come back to later. From this video I gained a basic understanding of the process of NLP and the kinds of insights that can be drawn, but I also found that there were some topics that I was interested in looking further into. For example, I would like to look more into using Pandas, python packages, and stemming.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the early afternoon, I also looked into other resources, such as the ones that ChunLei sent me on Friday. I looked into resources like Vik’s Blog, towards data science, and sentdex. These resources brought up some very interesting concepts that I had not seen before, and which I will definitely need to look more into. From Vik’s Blog, I think I will research more about Linear Regression, since this is a concept that has come up in my Scientific Computing course, but I would need to do more research to see how exactly it is being applied to NLP and this project. From toward data science, I am interested in doing more research about what tool might be best suited for this project. I know that Python was mentioned before, but it may also be worth looking into R and TensorFlow. I also learned about the difference between the classical ML model and Deep Learning. Classical ML is where you train the model using feature extraction on the input and then classification on the extracted features. Deep Learning is where the feature extraction and classification happen together in one step using neural networks. From sentdex, I will definitely look more into NLTK, since it seems to have some extremely useful built-in tools. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  ChunLei directed me to a site called Amazon SageMaker. He recommended that I not worry too much about the math and the details of the project, but rather get a better understanding of high level concepts. After reading through the documentation, I found that one particular feature that might be useful for this project is Named Entity Recognition or NER. This feature sifts through text data to locate phrases and categorize them into labels like person, organization, or brand. I think that this labelling could be extremely useful for Spend Categorization. However, one problem is that based on the resources that I have seen so far, it seems that NER is used in sentences, whereas I am not sure what form our data will look like. Another problem is that NER categorizes sequences based on predefined labels, which would not be cohesive with the desire for a more dynamic model. NER is definitely a topic that I will spend time researching more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Later, I had a meeting with Rahiv, Kiran, Cameron, and some new faces including Daniel and David from Business, and Anuj from Kiran’s team. We talked more about the expectations of this project and the pacing. David offered some insight about stemming vs. lemmatization, and suggested that lemmatization might be more accurate. I agree with him and would definitely implement this approach when it comes to that point in the project. I asked some questions about if previous projects have used classical ML or deep learning, but it seemed that the decision of which is best suited for this project will be left up to me. We ran out of time during this meeting since there was a lot to discuss, but I am looking forward to sharing more about what I have learned and asking more questions in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the end of the workday, I started looking more into classical ML vs Deep Learning. It seems like classical ML is much more approachable and may be easier to implement, but Deep Learning will probably do a better job of accomplishing the dynamic and self-learning model that Business is asking for. I need to do more research about Deep Learning and specifically Neural Networks to see if this is something that I would realistically be able to learn and get started on during the summer. The best and most efficient ways are always the hardest to implement :,). 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unrelated to work, I found out that I have some connections to other Fidterns! An intern in my mentor group, Benjamin, knows a friend from high school, and another SWE Fidtern, Cassie, knows one of my friends from Mudd! Additionally, I’ve continued talking to my mentor group, and today Nancy added a new member, Jenna, who shared pictures of her adorable dog. :)
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tomorrow, I plan to start looking into some of the topics that I came across today, particularly classical ML vs Deep Learning, Neural Networks, NER, Automatic Feature Extraction, and word2vec. I don’t anticipate that I will be able to get to all of these topics tomorrow, but it’s a starting point into more research! Tomorrow there is also a CTG intern meet-up in the afternoon, where I’m looking forward to meeting other interns in my business unit.

                  Today was the last day of webinars! It was nice to learn so much during training, but honestly, I think I’m ready for a change of pace. Sitting through long Zoom meetings is getting quite exhausting and I’m looking forward to learning more technical skills through projects. This morning we had a pretty information-heavy webinar about HR and specifically about the protocol for logging the hours we work. Then in the early afternoon we played some fun icebreaker games. At noon we had an intern meet-and-greet session where I got to know some interns from Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I had a meeting with Kiran today to update him on what Cameron and I talked about yesterday. Kiran was able to provide me with a lot more detail about the project’s current status and what my role on the project might be. He also put me in contact with an NLP specialist, ChunLei. ChunLei was able to explain a lot of insight about NLP and how it would play into what the Business team was asking for. ChunLei also pointed me to some really great introductory resources that I was able to get started with.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the rest of the afternoon, I looked into the resources ChunLei recommended as well as some resources that I found on my own during my online research. I have learned a lot of introductory material about topics like NLP, Deep Learning, Tokenizing, etc. In the coming week or so, I anticipate that I will be spending a lot of time self-studying these topics and getting more familiar with NLP at a high conceptual level. I have found that the more I learn about these topics, the more questions I have for the Business team regarding what they expect for their new Spend tool. For example, I am wondering what kind of data I will specifically be working with and how I might access the data if it is from 3rd party sources. I am also wondering about the new categorization aspect. What would necessitate new categorization? How specific would the categorizations be? How generally can we lump items together? Lastly, I would wonder if there is a strong preference for Python because of previous infrastructure or ease of implementation into the existing tools or if this preference is due to the existing packages? I will definitely try and ask these questions in Monday’s meeting with the Business team and with Kiran.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout the day, I also remained in contact with my mentor group, which was a lot of fun! Next week, I hope to keep in contact with the interns I have met this week and to keep learning about new topics like NLP. I am still getting used to the corporate structure and making sure that I am on top of my meetings.

                This morning, like the 3 mornings before, consisted of more webinars. Today we learned about strategies we can use to make the most of our internships, like making connections and getting involved in different groups. Later, we heard from FYPN (Fidelity Young Professionals Network) and some details about the mentorship program. Coincidentally, my mentor reached out to me today and I got to meet her for the first time (more on that later).
              </p>
              <p>
                In the afternoon, I had my meeting with Cameron from Procurement Business Analytics. Unfortunately, Daniel had a last-minute conflict and could not make it to the meeting. I got to introduce myself to Cameron and hear about the project that I might be able to get involved with. From his explanation, I think I would be interested in joining this project. I’ll try and explain the main ideas of what I learned, but there was quite a lot of new information to absorb. Procurement is a department that deals with purchasing items for Fidelity, which can include anything from software and hardware equipment to the desks and chairs used in office. Procurement has to classify these purchases into the appropriate categories to log their spending. The current model is using a rule-based system. However this model is not very flexible, so the project I have the opportunity to get involved with would classify the spending using NLP (Natural Language Processing) using past data of similar spend and possibly enrich the data with third parties to align with industry changes. I’m not totally sure what this means quite yet and some of the terminology is confusing, but I will definitely do some research so that I can come up with more specific questions to ask at the next meeting! I haven’t worked with NLP before this, so I will definitely have a lot of new things to learn and catch up with.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cameron mentioned that this project is in its very early stages of planning, so on the bright side, this means that I might not have as much catching up to do in regard to this project before I get involved. I’m not quite sure who exactly I would be working with, but since I am new to NLP, I would love to have some guidance or specific people I can reach out to with NLP questions. I think this would make the learning process a lot more comfortable and allow me to make more connections. :) Tomorrow I will meet with Kiran and Rajiv to update them on what I talked to Cameron about.
              </p>
              <p>
                This afternoon, I also met with my FYPN mentor, Nancy! We talked for about half an hour mostly about non-work related things, which was a nice break. I was added into a group chat with two other interns who are Nancy’s mentees, Anushka and Benjamin. It was nice to be able to connect with other interns and hear about the experiences of someone newer to Fidelity. I look forward to talking to them more throughout the next couple weeks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tomorrow is the last day of training! I’m looking forward to getting started on projects and learning as well as connecting with other interns.

                  I started off my morning by joining the APT Scrum meeting. I got to meet the Accounting Dev Team as well as some of the India team. As mentioned yesterday, the Scrum call was a daily status call where the team updates each other on the progress they are making and brings up any problems that they are facing. Specifically, I got to hear from Ramya, the Scrum Master for APT. I got a rough idea of the workflow within the team, but to be completely honest, I had no idea what was going on in terms of the projects that were being discussed. It was a bit intimidating to have so many new concepts swirling around, but on the bright side, this means that I’ll be able to learn a lot of new things!
                </p>
                <p>
                  After the Scrum meeting was the start of training for the day. The majority of training today was about ERGs, which are Employee Resource Groups. We got to hear from the heads of many groups such as Fidelity Pride, AERG (Asian Employee Resource Group), FiVe (Fidelity Veteran Employees), WLG (Women’s Leadership Group), Fidelity Enable, and WITSIG (Women in Technology Special Interest Group). This webinar was quite long, but it was a good way to hear the insights from Fidelity members across many different business groups. After the session I signed up to join AERG, WLG, and WITSIG. I’m looking forward to getting involved and meeting new people from different fields via these groups. :)
                </p>
                <p>
                  Later we had a shorter webinar from Fidelity Cares, which told us about how Fidelity is involved in local communities. As part of the webinar, we participated in a project where we recorded ourselves reading children's books to be sent to local Boys and Girls Clubs across the country.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the afternoon, I met with Rajiv to talk about his experience at Fidelity as well as to learn more about what happened in the Scrum meeting from the morning. I got to hear about Rajiv’s journey from being an international student studying electrical engineering to getting involved in databases via Oracle and finally working at Fidelity. I also learned a lot about the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. From what I understand, the Waterfall method includes a lot of planning and iterative testing before developments are rolled out. On the other hand, the Agile method includes more frequent deployments based on input from the user and follows the ideology of “pacing over perfection.” Rajiv explained to me that APT uses Agile, with Scrum meetings as a way to check up on the individual members of the team and progress they are making or the problems they are facing. This definitely cleared up a lot of what I was wondering about the workflow and team dynamics at a high/conceptual level, but there is plenty more for me to learn about the process and dynamics of the team. Perhaps I will read up on Agile and Scrum in my free time this week!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lastly, Rajiv asked me to set up a meeting with Cameron from Procurement Business Analytics. I sent a Zoom invitation to him for 3pm EST tomorrow, where I will be meeting with him as well as Daniel. This meeting is just for me to introduce myself, since it seems like I may be working with them during my internship, as well as get an idea of what their team is working on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Looking forward to more training and meeting new people tomorrow!

                  Today was pretty similar to yesterday in terms of having mostly webinar training and getting to know the team that I will be working with this summer a bit better. I think I am getting more comfortable with the platforms that Fidelity uses to communicate across the firm, but there is still quite a lot to get used to over the next week. I signed up to be on Digital Champions on Yammer and posted an introduction, which I hope will help me connect me with other interns this summer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My morning started with a few webinars. We had a brief overview of Fidelity’s history, structure, and financial services. I thought this was a good way to contextualize the work that we will be doing in the upcoming weeks. Some of the terms mentioned were familiar to me from the Econ courses I’ve taken, but there was plenty of information that was very new to me! The next two webinars were about the technology tools that Fidelity uses. We learned about the different roles of Yammer, Microsoft Teams, Skype, Fidelity Central, Workday, Outlook, and Zoom. While this helped me understand the tools, I am still a bit overwhelmed with the amount of locations to check information on. I think I will become more familiar with this software as I continue to use it.

                <p>
                  Later in the afternoon, I got to talk to my manager, Rajiv, and meet Kiran, who is in charge of procurement. I think that I will probably be working closely with Kiran’s team since they work primarily in Python, which is one of my strongest languages. It was nice to talk to Rajiv and Kiran and hear about their experiences at Fidelity. Based on what I’ve heard Fidelity seems to have a flexible and balanced work environment!. I will also be attending tomorrow morning’s daily scrum meeting, just to listen in and meet more of the team. :) I look forward to hearing about what my mentors/coworkers have been working on and getting to work alongside them and learn skills from them throughout the internship.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tomorrow’s training will likely include more webinars and getting familiar with Fidelity’s technology and culture. I’ll try and keep active on Yammer and engage with the team I will be working with, even though we are virtual!

                      Today was my first day as an intern! This week will primarily be training via online webinars and some meetings with my manager, but I am excited to start learning more about Fidelity and the role that I can play within the firm.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I started the morning off by setting up my work laptop. I received two laptops and I am not sure if this was intentional and I will be using both or if this was a mistake. I have reached out to the University Talent team to ask about this issue. I then spent about 2 hours going through my Fidelity email’s inbox and getting acquainted with the different platforms that the firm uses, such as Yammer, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, etc. I found it interesting that Fidelity uses so many different platforms. I am still a bit overwhelmed with trying to keep up with all the platforms, but I anticipate that there is a high learning curve and I will get used to using all these platforms to connect with my new co-workers! :)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      At 10am we moved onto the webinars. Today’s webinars included a welcome webinar which welcomed all interns to the firm, a Cyber Safety webinar which educated interns about how to protect ourselves and Fidelity from cyberattacks, and a Intentional Connections webinar which addressed how to create meaningful personal relationships while working remotely. I found these webinars pretty informative and I especially enjoyed the Intentional Connections webinar, since I find it a bit more difficult to communicate with people virtually instead of in-person. I am looking forward to more useful information via webinar throughout the week!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I was also able to get in contact with my manager (Rajiv) this morning. He introduced me to another member of the team and discussed what I might expect from the internship. It seems that I will be on the Oracle team. Rajiv mentioned that they work closely together with the procurement team, so my role may include being a liaison between the teams. He specifically mentioned that I might be doing some documentation and working with Python and Java during my internship. I am looking forward to learning more about Agile and development releases, since Rajiv mentioned these two areas which I don’t have much previous experience with. This seems very different from my CS experience last summer and I am looking forward to learning a lot of new CS applications through this new experience!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Tomorrow holds another full day of webinars and hopefully I can meet more of my fellow interns as well as getting to know the team I will be working with this summer!

                This summer I am working as a Software Engineer Intern as part of the CTG (Corporate Technology Group) business group. Specifically, I am working as part of the FPAIT (Finance Procurement Accounting Infrastructure Team).
                <br> I am working in close partnership with the Business Procurement Team to implement NLP into their Spend classification process so that it is more flexible and requires less manual upkeeping than the current rule-based model requires.
