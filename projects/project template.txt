On the other hand, another objection to Decartes’ argument that we cannot be sure of anything other than our own existence is that the demon’s deceptions must be based on some reality or truth. Even if the demon’s truths have been twisted into a deception, there must be some kernel of truth that the deceptions were formed from. For example, even if the demon is deceiving us about 2+3=5, the fact that this deception exists might imply the existence of quantities such as 2 3 and 5 or the existence of some relationship between quantities or the existence of the concept of equivalence, even if 2+3 = 5 is not true. This relates to ideas in Decartes’ first meditation about how even though dreams and paintings are not themselves reality, they are based on some form of reality. In the second meditation, Descartes doubts his imagination since he is doubting his senses. However, by the logic used in the first meditation, even if everything we sense and imagine is a deception, these deceptions must have some origin. This origin could be the malicious demon’s imagination or some other source. The specific source doesn’t necessarily matter, but if there is a deception then there must be some source of deception, which implies that there is some kind of truth or reality even if it is not the one that we perceive. So, even if we assume that everything is a deception and we thus cannot trust our senses or imagination, the fact that the deception exists implies the existence of a truth or reality from which the deception originated. Even if we cannot know this exact truth or reality, we can be sure that it exists, so we can be sure of more than our own existence.
