                  This morning Kip and I worked for about two hours on creating a template for our top statistics/navigation bar and fixing up the bottom navigation bar. Initially, we wanted to create the top navigation bar using createMaterialTopNav like we had done to create the bottom navigation bar previously. However, since we wanted to include a progress bar in the middle, which wouldn’t navigate to a new screen, we decided to just create icons with onPress navigation to our Character and Settings screens. We also weren’t sure if we would face issues with having two navigation bars on the same screen, so implementing our top navigation in this way would also avoid this problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Initially, we faced a lot of problems with getting the top navigation bar to be visible on the screen. Our first approach was similar to how we implemented our bottom navigation using stack navigator and importing screens, but for some reason this was not working. We messed around with moving it’s position on the stack navigator, importing screens, and deleting screens. We found out that if we hid the bottom navigation, we could see our top navigation bar. For the sake of being able to work on the template, we temporarily commented out the other screens so we could see the top navigation. Using a lot of the insights from last week’s TaskList work session regarding adding containers and flexbox properties, we were able to correctly format the icons for the character screen, progress bar, and settings screen onto the same line with the desired screen. Once we were happy with the formatting, we had to go back to fixing the issue of not being able to see the top navigation when the bottom navigation. Kip came up with the idea of loading the top navigation in the bottom navigation screen, to avoid the problem of only being able to see one at a time. This worked as desired and we were able to have the top and bottom navigation at the same time and both functional! We were able to add the onPress navigation to the Character and Settings screen using onPress and navigation.navigate so that users could click on the icons and be directed to the right screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We also spent a few minutes fixing up our bottom navigation since we had moved the settings and character screens to the top navigation. We also added a ‘Habits’ page to the bottom navigation and found a corresponding icon. In terms of next steps, we might need to implement a button to go back to the original screens from the Character and Settings screens. Currently, users can only navigate back to the main app from the Character and Settings screens by swiping left, but this might not be very intuitive. We also might be able to start working on the settings screen next week or in the near future, which might include features like changing user ID or color schemes.

                    <p>Fixing Async Storage</p>

                  Today Kip, Allen, Wayne, and I met up to work through some issues with Async storage. Allen and Wayne have been primarily working with this issue, so they started off the meeting by sharing what they had tried and what they were having issues with. Next, we compiled some articles that walked through how to use Async storage with React Native and tried following along with these tutorials. We ran into quite a few obstacles along the way, but ultimately, with some tweaks, new dependencies, and new files we were able to figure out how to use Async storage to save a user ID. Hopefully this will help Allen and Wayne with their Login screen progress, and we can apply the same ideas of Async storage to other aspects of the app like coins, quests, characters, etc. so that our app works in the way that we want.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The last step was to run some tests to make sure we were correctly saving the userID and that we would be able to retrieve the userID when needed. We had some trouble with this portion initially since AsyncStorage returns objects as promises, so we were not able to see the userID as a string. Eventually, using await and .getItem(), we were able to create an alert that welcomes the user to the app using their userID! We probably won’t have this alert in the final app, but this is a good way to test that the userID is stored and retrievable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today I also realized that it might be useful to apply some of the project management strategies that I’ve learned through my Fidelity internship to this project. In my internship, my team uses a backlog to keep track of features to implement during their Agile sprints. Our app project doesn’t use sprints, but I think that organizing a backlog of features that have yet to be implemented could be helpful. The backlog is organized according to the MoSCoW Prioritization, which has 4 categories: Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won’t Have. Must Haves are items that are vital in order for the product to be considered successful/functional. For our app, these would be the minimum features that we would need for our prototype by the end of the summer. Should Haves are items that are high-priority but not essential. So for our app these would be the items that make our app unique and would be the first things we would work on adding to the prototype, but are not essential for functionality. Could Haves are items that would be nice or are desirable, but are not necessary for the app. These features might be included in the first updates of our app. Won’t Haves are items that were brainstormed but may end up being rejected because they aren’t feasible or no longer align with the vision of our app. I’m planning to bring up MoSCoW prioritization during Sunday’s meeting and seeing what the rest of the team thinks.

                  Today we had a bit of a smaller meeting than usual. Allen and I brainstormed some names, but weren’t able to make a lot of progress from last week and felt a bit stuck. When Wayne showed up, we decided to brainstorm themes for the app or components of the app. We thought that having a more solid theme idea might help us find a direction for brainstorming names instead of just having basic names about “List” or “Task.” We were able to come up with quite a few themes surrounding travel, customization, and animals. Next week when we have more of the team together, we might expand on some of these themes and ideas or narrow down which ones we think best fits the vision for our app. Once we have a theme, we hope to have more productive and creative brainstorming ideas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Next we went around and updated as well as we could for the different components. Allen and Wayne have fixed the ‘Next’ button! This means that users can navigate from the home screen to the main app. However, while this works on Allen’s phone, we found that it doesn’t show up on other devices. Allen and Wayne will look into what is causing this issue, but they suspect that it is because of the hardcoded top and bottom margins. Allen and I talked about our progress on the Task List screen with moving the checkbox to the left of the task and implementing a ‘Remove’ button for each task. We also mentioned that we weren’t able to implement the automatic moving of the text for completed tasks and that the edit feature isn't working. I provided updates on me and Kip’s progress with implementing the swipeable navigation. I also mentioned that I added a hand-drawn template for the top naviagtion bar in our Visual Documentation, but we weren’t able to complete a template in code. I brought up the idea of swiping down to get to the view character screen to bring more emphasis to the character customization aspect of the app and it seems like Allen and Wayne are on board with the idea, so I will look into ways to implement this further down the line.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Allen brought up our Visual Documentation folder to make sure that we were keeping track of our app progress as we continued working on the app. We also discussed some tips or advice for working remotely together. Mainly, we wanted to make sure that subteam members were being vocal about changes they were making to the code or what they were researching during team meetings to make sure that everyone is on the same page.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We briefly reiterated what we planned to do next week. Allen and Wayne will make sure that the ‘Next’ button is visible on all screen sizes. The Task List subteam will work on fixing ‘Edit’ functionality and implementing the feature that moves completed tasks to the bottom of the list. Kip and I will create a template for the top naviagtion bar. Since we don’t yet have a View Character or Settings screen, we will create placeholder screens so that we can test that the buttons lead to the correct screens. Although the subteams are making good progress with these current screens, there are still quite a few screens that we haven’t started working on yet. We may have to start implementing these screens pretty soon in order to have a functioning prototype by the end of the summer. Allen and Wayne mentioned that they could start working on the Quest Screen once they finish the Home Screen. Kip and I will start working on the Settings Screen once the Navigation components are finished. Our Task List subteam will work on the Habits page once we have finished the main To Do Screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An issue that we have run into a couple of times is Async storage. Since this component will appear in quite a few parts of our app, we feel that we should all be involved in this process. Allen and Wayne have primarily been working through our storage issues thus far. They will fill us in on what has and hasn’t worked so far with what they’ve tried. We plan to meet next Saturday to hopefully make some progress and talk through the issues. Excited for more progress next week and the possibility of getting started on new screens!

                  Last night, Kip was able to fix the dependency issues with the packages by reinstalling all the necessary packages. :) With these issues fixed, we were able to get working on what we had set out to work during our last meeting. Our aim for this session was to move the check box to the left of the task text and implement a button to allow users to delete tasks. This setup is similar to how other apps allow users to add and delete items, so hopefully this setup will make it more intuitive for users.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first step was to move the checkbox from the left side of the text to the right side of the text. This proved to be a bit more challenging than we originally anticipated. The first, most straightforward step to move the position of the checkbox’s code to be before the text’s code. Since React Native renders items left to right, this would move the checkbox item to the left of the text as desired.  However, this led to some problems with flexbox widths. Somehow, the boxes had expanded to the full width of the screen, which meant that the checkbox and the text were left-aligned on separate lines. It took quite a while of experimenting with flexboxes and different parameters like flex-wrap, justifyContent, flex-direction, align-items, align-content, etc. Eventually, we were able to create appropriately sized boxes by hard-coding widths and putting an additional container around the text boxes to control the size of it’s flexbox without affecting the layout of the text. With the correctly sized text boxes, we were able to move the checkbox button and the text onto the same line using flex-direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our next step was to create a button that allows users to delete tasks from their list using an ‘X’ button. The tutorial that we worked off of last week included a function for a delete button, so we were able to re-implement this button pretty quickly and easily. Lastly, we translated our hardcoded widths to flex values in order to make our layout more flexible to different sizes of screens without running into formatting issues. We also quickly made some aesthetic changes regarding colors and spacing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We discovered that the edit feature was no longer functioning after we made our changes today. This will be our first priority for next week since it's an essential part of our Task list’s functionality. I’m not quite sure what happened between last week and this week, but we’ll look more into this next week. Unfortunately, we weren’t able to implement the feature where completed tasks move to the bottom of the list automatically or allow users to move the items manually. We may try to get completed tasks to move to the bottom of the list next week, since this is pretty important in terms of usability.

                  Today Allen, Kip, and I worked for about an hour on the Task List screen, but weren’t able to make much progress. :( Unfortunately, we kept getting error messages about incorrect or unfound packages and dependencies. We spent a lot of time trying to debug but with no luck. Kip said that she would look into the errors and we’ll reconvene tomorrow morning.

                  A short navbar update entry for today. Kip and I worked on implementing the swipe feature to the bottom navigation bar for about an hour and talked through some items for the top naviagtion bar. We worked based on the tutorial found last Saturday and though there were a couple obstacles, it was pretty straightforward!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Initially, we had implemented the navigation bar using createBottomTabNavigation (from two weeks ago). This allowed us to create a clickable bottom navigation bar, but did not allow for swiping. We tried to see if we could implement swiping using creatBottomTabNavigation or even with createMaterialBottomTabNavigation for a while, but did not have any luck. It turns out that in order to have a swipeable bottom navigation bar, we needed to use createMaterialTopTabNavigation and specify that placement should be at the bottom. Admittedly, this seems a little messy, but createMaterialBottomTabNavigation does not allow for swiping. :( The ‘Material’ aspect of the createMaterialTopTabNavigation also allows for the animation of sliding screens when swiping. With the swiping functionality enabled, users still have the functionality to click the buttons on the bottom navigation bar to get to different screens. Once functional, to keep the navigation bar clean, we decided to remove the labels and only display icons on the navigation bar. Since there are only 3 screens and we will display the name at the top of each screen, we felt that the labels were unnecessary. After some quick formatting changes, we finished up our new swipeable bottom navigation bar. :)
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the last part of our meeting, we talked about the top naviagtion bar. Unfortunately, we did not have time to implement the top naviagtion bar template, but since none of the screens or elements for the top naviagtion bar have been started yet and we are finished with the bottom navigation bar, we should  have plenty of time to work on the top naviagtion bar next week. I also brought up being able to swipe down to get to the view character screen and we agreed we could bring it up on Sunday’s meeting to get the rest of the team’s thoughts.

                  Another productive team meeting! We started off by catching up on what each subteam was up to. Allen and Wayne talked about how they tried to change the format of the LogIn Screen to allow navigation onto a different screen using a ‘Next’ button. Since it didn’t really work, they plan to continue working on it this week. They were also able to fix the text box, so that it correctly underlines the user’s name. They mentioned that they looked more into asynchronous storage, but without much luck. Allen, Kip, and I talked about what we accomplished this week with the Check/Uncheck functionality and what we still needed to accomplish with moving tasks around and implementing a ‘Habits’ page (see yesterday’s post for more details!). Kip and I brought up what we discussed for the top naviagtion bar. As a group we agreed that we would have our ‘View Character’ button in the left corner with an image of the user’s avatar as the icon; we would have our settings in the right corner; we would have some way to measure progress or view inventory in the middle. We are thinking that we can measure progress with collecting coins or a general progress bar. Unfortunately, Elissa was not able to make it to today’s meeting, but she mentioned that she worked on separating the avatar into clean katers so that each layer can be changed differently and layered smoothly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a team, we also brainstormed some ideas for collection items and themes so that we are ready to start prototyping quest elements when the time comes. We are thinking of just using coins for our functional prototype for simplicity’s sake, and we can change from coins to some other item later on. As mentioned in a previous entry, we were thinking that users earn coins from completing tasks. There was some discussion about if these coins would be used to directly buy quests and buy items or if users would unlock quests once they had enough coins and win items from those unlocked quests. For the second option, in order to keep the customization element of the app, we were thinking of allowing users to choose from 3 options of items to unlock instead of just giving them a specified item for each quest unlocked. We then talked about what we wanted for our quest format. We mentioned a storyline initially and we were thinking that the quests could move through different countries or regions of the world. I really like this idea since it allows users to explore diverse cultures and shows representations of many different parts of the world. This might allow users to learn new things through our app as well! :)
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some other topics we discussed were design research and storage options. Allen proposed that we look into popular apps and see if we are inspired by some of those features. For example, we liked the swipe navigation found on Snapchat and Tinder. Looking into other apps for features that we enjoy might allow us to make our app more user-friendly. Allen and Wayne also brought up Firebase as a storage option, since it seems easier to implement and use. I don’t know much about Firebase, but I can definitely look into it more on my own time. We spent a little while brainstorming names and came up with some fun options, but we aren’t totally sure about a name yet. We will likely continue having 5-10 minute brainstorming sessions every week during our meetings!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, we talked about what we wanted to improve or incorporate into each subteam’s component for the coming week. Allen and Wayne mentioned working on the ‘Next’ button and the Firebase storage for the LogIn screen. Our Task List subteam will work on automatically moving completed tasks to the bottom of the list and adding a delete button. If we have time, we can work on allowing users to move tasks on their own and adding the habits page, otherwise we will implement this further down the line. Kip and I will work on the swipe functionality since it seems relatively straightforward to implement. We will also work on a template/preliminary version of the top nav bar. I’m excited to keep working on the app and see what progress we can make for next week!

                  Today most of the progress was with the TaskScreen portion of the app. Allen, Kip, and I met for about 2-3 hours to work on the TaskScreen. Allen found a tutorial online that had a lot of useful information about how to make a shopping list app. We were able to apply a lot of ideas from this tutorial to our To Do List screen. From the tutorial we were able to fix our text input problem, so now we have a fully functioning button where users can type in their tasks and add it to the todo list! The tutorial’s template also fixed our issue from last week where the list items were just text boxes. Now, each list item appears as a separate object with its own properties. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once we had the list items, we wanted to make some alterations for what happens when you complete a task. The original/tutorial version would just allow users to delete the task once they were finished, but we thought it would be more rewarding and thus more motivating if users were able to check off tasks without deleting them so they could see how many tasks they were finishing. We spent the majority of today’s meeting implementing a check box. When the user clicks an empty check box to signify that they have completed the task, then the box becomes checked and the text is grayed and struck through. Users can also uncheck boxes to ‘un-complete’ them, which returns the text to its original state and returns the box to its empty state. We had some confusion due to repeated variable names and unclearly named functions, but once we had a better grasp of what each function and variable’s purpose was, we were able to get our code running smoothly!
                </p>
                <p>
                  An additional feature that we would like to add is that when the user completes a task it should automatically move to the bottom of the list. We think this will keep the screen organized and allow users to easily keep track of which tasks they still need to complete, while still being able to see their progress and how many tasks they have completed. We would also like to allow users to move tasks around so that they can organize the list in a format that they like or in the order that they plan to complete the tasks. We also need to re-implement the ability to delete tasks in case users want to remove tasks from the list. We may implement a button that clears all completed tasks as well. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additionally, today we talked about how we might want to make a habits page in addition to our to do list. If there are tasks that users need to complete every day, then it may be tedious to re-input those tasks every day, so we want to make a different page that refreshes the same ‘habit’ tasks each day. Additionally, we want to implement a feature that keeps track of how many days in a row that the habits have been completed. This ‘streaks’ feature would be a good motivator for users to keep up daily habits. We may do this with a calendar feature like Fitbit’s daily exercise tracking feature. Once we finish implementing the todo list page we will work on the habits page since it will have similar features to our to do list page that we can build off of.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today I also found a source that shows how to implement swipe functionality to a navbar. Kip and I can try implementing this swipe feature next week. This week we have spent time thinking about what we might want for a top naviagtion bar. Since our app has quest features, we want to implement a way for users to see their progress which would live at the top of the screen. Since we are adding a habits screen, we want to move the ‘view character’ feature to be part of the top navigation so that we can keep our 3-screen plan, while still allowing users to quickly access and customize their character. The top navigation is also where we would put our settings bar. I am also thinking about how we might consider using a swipe down feature for viewing the character, since just having a small button to view the character might de-emphasize the character customization aspect of the app. These are all things that we will discuss with the team tomorrow.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lastly, today I spent some time individually brainstorming app names, but most of the names are pretty basic and don’t stand out or emphasize why our app is different from exiting task managers, like ListQuest or TaskList. I think that it might be easier to brainstorm names as a group and talk through some ideas. Looking forward to seeing the group’s progress tomorrow!

                  In today’s meeting we caught up on the progress from our subgroups and started talking about how we might piece our components together. I’ll give a quick walkthrough of where we are with each screen. Wayne and Allen have started on the home screen and have some basic functionality done, which is exciting! The user can enter their name and scroll to choose an ‘avatar’ (currently just some placeholder pictures). We plan to have this screen show up only when the user opens the app for the first time. Then Kip updated the group on where out subteam is regarding the task screen (Read Friday’s entry to read the details of our status). Next, I updated the group on where Kip and I got in terms of the navbar (read Saturday’s entry for details on that). Lastly, Elissa updated us on the current status of the character design. We’ve decided to go with a chibi-style character template and the design that Elissa shared looks great!
                </p>
                <p>
                  The next item of the meeting was a quick note on React dependencies from Kip. This was just to make sure that everyone knew that we need to run npm install when we pull from github since we use different libraries. She also drew our attention to the fact that we should be careful about noting the difference between React and React Native.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Next was the exciting part! We got to talk about how we might pull our components together into the cohesive app. We agreed that for our 3 screens, we wanted to have the Todo list in the center as the first thing that users would see when they logged in, and then have the quest and character screens on either side. We also talked about having the ability to swipe between screens in addition to using the navbar, similar to the way that Snapchat is formatted. We agreed that while this would be a nice feature to have, it was not an immediate priority, since our goal currently is to have a functioning prototype, and we will add the bells and whistles later. For now, we have the functioning navbar that Kip and I created, and if we are able to complete a functioning prototype before the end of summer, Kip and I can work on this additional feature. Lastly, we decided on a color scheme. We have chosen to keep a generally white background, with pastel pinks, purples, and blues. We talked about how we might implement the ‘dark mode’ option later on, since a lot of users prefer dark mode. Again, since this is not an essential feature, we will add this if after we get an initial functioning prototype. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lastly, we determined what we wanted to do before the next meeting. We will continue working in our subgroups from last week to continue to improve our tools. Allen and Wayne talked about how they will be adding a screen where users can customize their avatars, continue fixing up the makeProfile screen, and add an alert that navigates users to the main screen. Our tasklist subteam will continue working on the mechanism for adding new tasks and work towards getting a functioning prototype. Kip and I are happy with where the NavBar’s functionality is currently, but we will spend some time individually researching how to implement the swipe feature so that if we get the opportunity to work past a functional prototype, we will be more prepared to implement it. Elissa plans to continue working on character design and I’m excited to see what she comes up with! 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additionally, we have started brainstorming names and logos for this app. We don’t plan to call the final version ‘Gamified Task Manager’ so hopefully we can come up with a memorable name and a matching logo design. During the remaining time in the meeting we brainstormed as a group for about 10 minutes, but we plan to brainstorm on our own time within a shared document. Then during our next meeting, we will discuss our ideas together. That’s all for this week!

                  Today, Kip and I met to work on the Navbar. We used existing code that came with an online template. However, there were some bugs relating to the Task Screen that we had to fix before we could get going with the Navbar. After about half an hour of trial and error, we were able to get the nav bar to appear in its default form. From here, we changed the Navbar to have appropriate items for our app, which includes a todo list screen, a quest screen, a character appearance screen, and a settings screen. We mentioned following the convention of having only 3 screens, since this is standard for many apps (such as Snapchat and Tinder), so it would be more familiar and user-friendly if our app also followed this app. Our Navbar currently has 4 items, but we can move the settings into an upper right corner or some other location such that our Navbar has 3 items. This is someth	ing that we will bring up during tomorrow’s team meeting to get more insight. Kip and I also changed some colors such that when the user is on a screen, the icon for that screen will appear purple (this is a temporary color which we can change later when we have more solidly decided on aesthetics). At this point, we had a functioning version of a Navbar when we ran our code in Expo!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Something that is still confusing to me is the LinkingConfiguration.js file. It seems like this file is what allows the Navbar icons to actually link to other screens, but this is just my best guess. I will spend some time doing some online research to see if I can find anything more concrete. As is, our Navbar works pretty well! If the team has additional feedback about the appearance or setup of the navbar regarding colors, icon placement, icon appearance, or number of items, this should be a pretty easy fix for Kip and I to implement. I am overall very happy with the current state of the Navbar!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today I also spent some time becoming more familiar with our Github setup. Previously, I have only worked in the master branch when pushing and pulling, but with the help of Kip’s documentation, I was able to successfully set up VS Code to work in the developer branch! I spent some time making sure that I had the correct libraries downloaded and that I could view a test version of the app on my phone via Expo. With this set up, I will be able to work on components more independently as we move forward with development!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tomorrow is our next team meeting. I’m excited to see what progress the rest of the team has made. :) Additionally, I am looking forward to asking some of the questions that came up when Kip and I were working on the Navbar regarding color schemes, Navbar format, and general setup.

                  Up to this point in the week, I have been trying to do some individual learning with React Native and some of the more advanced React concepts. However, I am finding it a bit difficult to balance my internship and my role on this project. My original plan was that I would be able to dedicate some time to the project throughout the work week after my internship hours ended. However, I am finding it a bit exhausting to be working on code for so many hours a day. :( A more balanced approach might be to work on this project on Friday evenings, Saturday afternoons, and attending meetings on Sunday. I’m switching to this approach from this point onward so I can enjoy both my internship and this project without overworking myself. So from now on, I’ll be posting progress updates on Fridays and Saturdays, then I’ll post meeting updates on Sundays.

                <p>
                  This evening I met with Allen and Kip to work on the todo list screen. We had a lot of trouble with this portion and fixing the bugs. One of these problems was because of confusion between React and React Native. Since we are new to app building, we often look to online resources for guidance and inspiration, especially in these beginning stages. However, this code is oftentimes written in React, and since we are still getting familiar with React Native, it is easy to forget to translate React code into React Native. This leads to problems with syntax, for example switching from div to View, etc. We spent quite some time fixing these types of bugs, but ultimately were able to eliminate these syntax errors! We also had some issues with text inputs, which Allen mentioned was also a point of trouble when she and Wayne were working on the Home Screen. This is an issue we will need to look into in more detail, since it is an essential part of our app design. Another issue we had was with Asynchronous Storage. To be honest, I am not completely sure what this means. I will look into this and possible ways to fix this issue before our next meeting so that I can follow along a bit better and hopefully offer some insight.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We currently have very basic functionality for this screen, where the user can input text into a text box, but it is still not in the form that we are aiming for. We would like the text input prompt to occur when the user clicks a button for ‘Add Task’ and we would like the text to appear in a to do list instead of a plain text box. This is something that we can definitely work towards, but I am very happy with the progress we have been able to make in our first meeting!

                      Today was a pretty light day for my internship, so I was able to work on some individual learning with React Native after work! I finished Programming With Mosh’s React tutorial and started his React Native tutorial. I think I have a pretty good grasp of the concepts he talks about, but I anticipate that I will be solidifying these concepts as a start coding for myself.

                      In the next few days, I hope to learn more about React Native through online tutorials and I will also start working through the second Codecademy React tutorial which covers more complex React concepts (like Parent-Child relationships and lifting states). I may not blog over the next few days as I just continue following along with tutorials since it isn’t very exciting to write or hear about. When I start working with my sub-teams, I definitely plan to blog our process thoroughly!

                      We had our second team meeting today! Today’s meeting was pretty short, but we made some important decisions about next steps and did a lot of designation of tasks during this meeting. We started our meeting by discussing where we were with learning React so that we could gauge how comfortable people were with React. We also talked about which tutorials were most effective and compiled some additional resources. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The majority of the meeting was about how we would all be able to work on the app. We are using Github for source control, but we want to make sure that we don’t run into the issue of editing the same piece of code at the same time and trying to make conflicting pushes. Ultimately, we decided to split up based on the components of the app. We split into sub teams of 2 or 3, where each subteam will meet up and call as a group as the team works on the component. The team will follow the pair-programming model of a driver (write code) and a navigator (look out for errors) in order to write code. This set-up allows us to work collaboratively on the components of the add without bumping into each other. :) We discussed how we wanted to split up the components, which was a bit difficult, since there are some parts of the app that we have not completely finished ideating. Ultimately, we decided on the general components of a welcome/sign-on screen, a checklist as the main screen of the app, a quest screen, and a navbar, which will be visible on all screens except the login screen. We decided to wait on working on the quest portion of the app, since there is a lot of more advanced functionality that comes with this portion, which might be easier to write after we have gained familiarity with React Native by working on the other, simpler portions of the app. I am on the Checklist subteam with Allen and Kip. I am also on the Navbar subteam with Kip. It’s exciting to see our ideas come together and I am looking forward to bringing these ideas to life with code!

                      Additionally, we have officially brought on Elissa as a visual designer. This means that she will be working on how the character, background, and icons look.

                      For me, the next steps are completing a few React Native tutorials compiled from today’s meeting to get more familiar with the workflow and learn how to utilize the tools in React Native. I hope to meet with the subteams later in the week (Wednesday-Saturday) after doing some additional individual learning.

                      Today I was able to finish the Tic Tac Toe coding tutorial. I am definitely glad that I did the Codecademy tutorial first before jumping into this tutorial, since this tutorial definitely used some of the more advanced React concepts such as this.props and this.state that I definitely would not have understood if I had jumped straight into this tutorial. I thought that this Tic Tac Toe tutorial was a great way to get acquainted with how to use React in practice, since I got to put into practice a lot of the concepts that I had learned by doing Codecademy problems. This tutorial walked me through how to create a functioning game of Tic Tac Toe, where you can even go back and look at old moves!

                    <p>
                      I also spent some time today starting the Programming With Moch videos. I started the React tutorial, which has important information about how to set up your developer environment, but was also a bit repetitive since I have already learned quite a bit about React through Codecademy and the Tic Tac Toe tutorial. I was not able to finish this entire video today, but I hope to finish this video at some point in the next few days to solidify my foundation in React.js. Once I finish this video, I will follow along with Mosh’s video about React Native, since the React Native video builds off of the React video. The app we are aiming to build will be a mobile app, so we will likely be mainly using React Native.

                      We are having our second meeting tomorrow, and Elissa will be joining us! Elissa is interested in joining our project, but she is also quite busy with her internship, so she is planning to sit in on our meetings for a little while before deciding if she wants to commit to the team. In preparation for the meeting, I looked over the agenda and made sure I was on track with the tasks we agreed to complete. I am looking forward to catching up with the rest of the team about what they have been working on. :)

                    Over the week, I have been working through the Codecademy Javascript and React.js tutorials. You may notice the gap between this entry and the last entry. This week I prioritized educating myself on the BLM movement and trying to contribute my support however possible. For me, it was important to put my time towards doing what I can to address the issues that plague our nation and protest the extreme injustice faced by black Americans even if it means dedicating less time to learning new languages, especially since I know I will be able to catch up later. This project is important to me and I have still been putting time towards learning this project. At this point I have completed both these tutorials, and while I think that Codecademy tutorials are a good way to get familiar with a language and explore its capabilities, I am looking forward to learning more about React through practical applications.

                    Today I was also able to download Node.js. After some online research, I found that the error was coming from the browser I was using. It seems that Chrome is not compatible with downloading Node.js, but using Firefox worked out! Now that Node.js is downloaded successfully, I should be able to follow along with more of the tutorials that we talked about during the last meeting, such as the Tic Tac Toe example from react.js and the video tutorials by Programming With Mosh. I am looking forward to getting some hands on experience coding applications with React in the next few days.

                    Today I tried to start the React tutorials that were discussed in Thursday’s meeting. However, I am having some trouble downloading Node.js. :( Additionally, since it has been a while since I have used Javascript, I think I may have to go back and review the basics of Javascript.

                    Today I started working on Codecademy’s Javascript tutorial and I hope to continue working on this over the next few days! I also know that Codecademy has a React.js tutorial, so after I finish the Javascript tutorial, I will start working on the React tutorial.

                    We had our first team meeting today. We talked through our work breakdown structure in terms the basic components we would need to cover relating to defining our problem, understanding  user needs, designing a system, prototyping, and project management activities. We have decided that we will hold meetings every Sunday once internships and research start for most of our team. This part of our meeting allowed us to understand the big picture of how this project was going to work and helped to organize the team. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We talked through the pros and cons of different languages for mobile app development. Ultimately, we have decided to build the basic prototype of our app in React since it works with both iOS and Android. If we feel constrained by React we will consider switching to Xcode or even C++ later on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We also spent some time talking about our user group. Since our target age demographic is teens and 20s, we wanted to make sure we were appealing to this audience. We noticed that nostalgia for childhood is popular with this age group, so we may try and tie in the aesthetics from the 1990s and early 2000s (ex: Avatar, Animal Crossing, Club Penguin). For this age group representation and justice is very important, so we will make sure that our avatar customization features include representation options that are inclusive of groups that may not be well-represented in traditional media (POC and LGBTQ+). We also think that our storyline for our quests should include elements that are important to this age group, such as justice, free will, technology, etc.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Next, we discussed user interaction and what we felt was lacking from existing apps. We found that existing gamified task managers can be stressful in terms of “punishing” the user when they fail to complete tasks. Instead of punishment, we are thinking about encouraging “streaks” (keep completing tasks for consecutive days) by offering rewards.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lastly, we went through our team contract just to make sure we are all on the same page and to have a written agreement in the event that we run into issues or disagreements later. We decided that before the next meeting, we should all get familiar with React. We found a couple of online tutorials and agreed to complete or attempt them before our next meeting on June 7. At this point in the process its fun to see ideas come together and start learning new skills!

                      Today was the start of the project! We assembled our team, consisting of Allen, Kip, Wayne, and I. Allen is taking the lead on this project so far in terms of creating repositories, meeting agendas, and calendars. We have set up a meeting for this Thursday so that we can talk through some ideas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Allen, Kip, and I had a brainstorming session about what our app might look like through Discord chat. We think we might use a questline as the main feature of our app, where users collect items when they finish tasks and these items will be used in order to unlock new quests. When quests are finished the user can collect new avatar customizations. We were also considering character designs. We may integrate bitmoji in order to maintain the wide customization aspect. We were also considering drawing out our own character designs although this may be time consuming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Between now and Thursday, we plan to individually research what goes into app development so that we can come to a consensus about things to learn and how to split up tasks. I’m excited about where this project has the potential to go! :)

              This project was created by four Harvey Mudd Students (Allen Wu, Kip Lim, Wayne Ying, and myself).
              <br>We noticed a lack of fun gamified task managers that appeal to the younger age demographic, especially young women.
              <br>Our goal with this app is to help young people achieve their goals and have fun along the way!
