                  This morning Allen, Kip, and I were able to get the level incrementing working. We picked up where Allen and I left off last week. Kip was able to help us out and guide us through how we needed to layer promise.then() functions to get the levels incrementing correctly. We did some testing with checking and unchecking tasks to check that incrementing levels and xp were working as well as decrementing xp to be negative instead of decrementing the levels as we discussed a few weeks ago.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since we were able to finish the levels so early, we decided to continue working on the top navigation that Kip and I were having trouble with yesterday. We consulted quite a few online resources about await, usePromise, and promise.map(). Ultimately, we were able to get the xp and level values displayed as text with usePromise. However, the values were continuously flashing on and off and we got an error about having too many pending requests. We’re not sure how to fix this error, and online resources seem to say that this error has to do with unstable versions of react native and react navigation. Because of this error, we haven’t merged our local changes into the development branch, since it would cause our current stable prototype to become unstable. Although we’re able to access the values and display them as text, the progress bar still does not update. This is an open issue that we’ll have to revisit the next time we work on ths app.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today was our last app meeting, so we caught up with our progress for this week and listed out our open issues so we know where to pick up the next time we work on the app. This week, Allen and Wayne implemented a function that updates which levels are shown on the QuestScreen based on what level the user is on and were able to change the images displayed on the MakeProfile screen. Allen updated the team on our progress with incrementing levels. I updated the team on my and Kip’s progress with the character customization prototype and the struggles with the top navigation bar. We then updated the backlog to be up-to-date with our current progress so we would know what has already been done and what still needs to be done when we reconvene. We explicitly highlighted the main open issues that we have yet to resolve with our current prototype, namely the top navigation’s issues with displaying xp and level as well as updating the progress bar, implementing a habits screen based on our todo list screen, and updating the inventory of the character screen based on the level that the user is on. This is our last day of working on the app for this summer and I’m really proud of the progress we’ve been able to make over the last few months. We were able to implement pretty much all of our screens and even get Async storage working. Our remaining issues are regarding getting screens to interact with one another, which we’ve already started on with xp. We might reconvene over winter break, but that’s all for now! :)

                  Today Kip and I were able to get the prototype of the character customization screen working. Last week we struggled with being able to dynamically change the image of the character using the menu buttons using the require function. This week we decided to use a style property called ‘tintColor’ to change the color of the blob instead of actually changing the image of the blob for each color. We struggled a bit with the syntax of changing the state, but eventually we were able to get this working. TintColor changes the color by applying the specified color on all the nontransparent pixels of the image, so since our initial ‘blob’ is white, whatever color we specify in tintColor will appear. This works for our prototype, but eventually if we want to add patterns or other customization beyond color changing, we may run into issues and will need to change our implementation. For now, we have a functioning prototype/proof of concept of our character customization screen. :)
                </p>
                <p>
                  We also started working on displaying the xp in the progress bar of our top navigation bar. Initially, I thought this would be relatively simple. Since the xp value is just stored in Async storage and the progress bar can change its appearance based on whatever value between 0 and 1 is passed to it, I thought we could just pull the current xp out of Async storage, divide it by the xp needed to pass the level, and pass that decimal value into the progress bar. However, because of the way that promises work with Async storage, this was not nearly as simple as I anticipated. Using promise.then() works to manipulate the values, but it cannot return the value as a number, it can only return promises, which cannot be used by our progress bar. If we try to use other methods to resolve the promise value and just return the value stored in the promise, then when the xp is updated in Async storage, the resolved value will not change to reflect this update, so our progress bar won’t update in real time. Kip and I struggled with a few different, but were not able to come up with a solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is our last week working on the app for this summer, so we might just need to make a note of where we’ve left off and what we’ve tried and then continue working on this issue whenever we pick up on the app. Alternatively, if our TaskList team finishes early tomorrow, we might be able to work on the top navigation together. Although our progress bar isn’t working, I’m glad that we were able to get our character customization prototype working before the end of the summer.

                  Allen, Kip, and I were able to make some great progress today with the To do screen. We are finally able to get and store the XP using Async storage successfully! Last week, Kip and Allen found information about the way Async storage works with handling promises instead of values, so this is where we picked up this week. We spent the first hour testing with various console.log() statements to get better insight into what was happening within our promise function and to break down what was working and what was failing. Following online sources about promises, we tried using promise.then() statements to execute what we needed with saving and incrementing the XP. At this point, we were getting frustrated with the lack of progress we were seeing with our Async storage approach. Additionally, it was getting difficult to debug, since at one point, the application that we were using to render our app was crashing when it ran into an error instead of logging our error, so we had no idea what was going wrong.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At this point, we discussed the idea of ditching Async storage and moving to a counter variable of some sort instead. However after some discussion about inheritance and the long-term benefits of Async storage, we decided to continue working Async storage. It seems like having this discussion gave us some perspective or a much-needed break, because within 10 minutes of having this discussion about leaving Async storage behind, we were able to get our XP incrementation working with Async storage! We did this by using the promise.then() function. Before calling promise.then(), we resolved the value from GetXP so that we could use the up-to-date value of the XP. Within promise.then() we have a call to SaveXP, the input to which is the resolved GetXP() value which has been converted to a number and incremented appropriately before finally being converted back into a string. This is because we need to convert the value to a number so we can apply the math of incrementing, but we need to convert it back into a string because SaveXP can only save strings. Once this was finalized, we started working on resetting the XP when the user reaches the threshold for the next level. We are running into some issues with incrementing the level in the right place, but we can work on this next week.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We also had our weekly team meeting today. Like last week, this was a pretty short meeting. We essentially just caught up on what each subteam accomplished this week and what we plan to do next week. Allen and Wayne have figured out how to put specific images for each level, so that we can display the color that has been unlocked for each level. Next week, they plan to fetch the level from Async storage and update which levels are unlocked or not. Allen updated the team on our progress with getting XP working with Async storage and how we plan to implement saving the level that the user is on next week. I updated the team on Kip and I’s progress with implementing the blob and the menu formatting. Next week, we plan to get the menu onPress() working so that users can actually dynamically change the character appearance using the menu. Kip and I will also work on pulling the XP and level from Async storage so that we can display the user’s XP progress and level progress in the top navigation bar. We discussed that we would give users 3 default blob colors of black, gray, and white which will be initialized in the MakeProfile screen and give us a starting point for the character screen without needing to link the character screen to the quest screen for now.

                  Kip and I started implementing a placeholder blob character this week on the Character Screen. After struggling with Libmoji’s limited documentation and functionality for the last few weeks, we decided that it would be best to implement a simpler character which we have more control over. Eventually, we would like to implement a blob-shaped character, which Elissa might help us design, but for now, we’re using an image of different colored circles with transparent backgrounds. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our first step was to implement the format of our character display and menu. To do this we just used a few flex boxes and rendered our image into the top ⅔ of the screen with the bottom ⅓ reserved for the inventory, where users can select the color that they want their blob character to be changed to. We spent some time struggling with the formatting of the menu since we ran into the problem of aligning by row instead of column again, but eventually we were able to fix this. Our next step was to make it so that clicking on different colored circles in the menu would actually change the character’s color. Our plan is to use onPress for the menu icons to change color. We created a separate class for the menu so that it can inherit the color we want to customize and so that we can easily set the states. However, we ran into issues with passing the color into the image location so that we could render different colored circles based on the name of the file. To load in an image, react native uses a require() statement within the image source, but the input to require() must be a string, so it's hard to dynamically change the source of the image by passing in a variable, even if the variable stores a string. We tested a few different ways of passing information to require, but still are having no luck.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Next week, we will continue working on being able to dynamically change the image of the character using the menu buttons so that we have a functioning character screen. For now, I’m pretty happy with the progress we’ve made with setting up the format of the character screen for our new blob. Once we figure out how to change the image url using variables, we should be pretty close to finishing the prototype version of our character screen. :)

                  Today’s meeting was rather short. We essentially just went through each team’s progress since we nailed down the basic ideas of the app in the last 2 meetings. One change we decided to make is that we’re scrapping our use of Libmoji. Since Libmoji’s functionality does not match the functionality we want for our app, we’ll go with a simplistic ‘blob’ design, where users can customize their blob’s color. Colors will be unlocked with levels on the quest screen and we plan to render the blob just using an image. Since this is just our prototype having a blob instead of a character works for now.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Next, we caught up on our progress and discussed next steps. Allen and Kip are still having trouble with incrementing points and placing it into Async storage. It seems like the storing of the xp value is still the issue. Next week, we plan to try returning values and not promises. Next week, Kip and I will work on implementing our blob character instead of the Libmoji. We will also work on formatting the progress bar so that it shows the current level of the user. Allen and Wayne made a lot of progress with the Quest Screen and the Make Profile Screen. The Make Profile Screen only shows up the first time the user logs in and the levels are lined up. Next week, they will work on choosing specific colors/images for each level to show the user what they’ve unlocked. I shared the logo designs that I brainstormed yesterday. For now, we’re thinking of going with a simple test-based design for the app’s icon as it appears on user’s homescreens, a simple design that includes a hanger and a checkmark for the main logo, and we’re considering using the blob as our mascot. We’ll discuss with Elissa about the colors and details when the time comes since she’ll be able to finalize our design.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We’re coming to the end of summer, so we have a normal week of work next week, but the weekend after that we might have a later meeting since there's training we all have to attend on Saturday before school starts. Even if we don’t have a full prototype, I think we’ve been able to get a lot done so far and I’d love to continue working on this app during winter break or other free periods. :)

                  This week, I’m taking a break from working directly with app code. Instead, I’ve decided to brainstorm some potential app logos and think about how we might implement an alternative to Libmoji, since Libmoji’s functionality doesn’t seem to align with what we need for our app. I came up with about 8 different logo designs. Some are more text-based, some include a mascot or an aspect of our app’s theme of travelling, but most include a combination of the fashion and checklist aspects of our app. After designing these logos, I’m leaning towards some of the more simplistic designs. I plan to share these designs with the rest of the team tomorrow to see if they like these designs. In terms of an alternative to Libmoji, as a team we’ve discussed using a simple blob as our character. I think we could definitely use this for our prototype. We might ask Elissa to design a simple blob with a transparent background, where the color changes when users click on certain inventory buttons. I’ll ask what the team thinks of the blob idea in tomorrow’s meeting as well.

                  This morning Kip, Allen, and I started our task of incrementing XP when users check off a task. Our approach was to use Async storage in a similar way to how we saved userID a few weeks ago. This approach allows multiple components of the app to access the same XP value and allows the XP to stay stored so that it doesn’t get reset when the user exits out of the app. However, we ran into issues with object types. Async storage only stores string values, but XP should be a numeric value since we need to increment and decrement the value. We tried to store it as a string in Async storage and just convert it to a number when we need to increment and decrement the value, then convert it back to a string when we save the value back to storage. However, we kept getting NaN values instead of the values we were expecting. We tried testing different approaches for where we were converting values and we added print statements throughout our code to see where the error was coming from. It seems like the error is coming from the step where we save the xp, but we aren’t sure how to proceed. We seem to be stuck this week, but we will continue to work through this problem next week.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Later, we had our weekly team meeting. We started the meeting by talking through some of the app logistics. We confirmed some of the concepts we discussed last week, like how users’ XP is tracked by the progress bar at the top of each screen, then when the XP reaches a set amount where the progress bar is full, the next level will automatically check off and the user will get an alert that the level has been unlocked and the progress bar will zero out again. Once the level is checked off, the user can navigate to the quest screen to collect the new item. The item will only be added to the user’s inventory when they click on the quest and collect the item. We talked through some additional details, like if a user has already passed a level, but then they go back and uncheck a task, they will have negative XP in the progress bar instead of reverting the level and removing the item. Ultimately, the user still has to collect the same amount of XP to unlock the next level in either situation. But the negative XP method seems more simplistic and more intuitive. We also decided that the level numbers should be split by chapter, so it will be level 1.9 or level 2.6 instead of just continuously increasing the level number regardless of the chapter number (Ex: if chapter 1 has 10 levels, the 11th level would be level 2.1 instead of level 11).
                </p>

                  Lastly, we caught up on this week’s progress and discussed next week’s plans. Allen and Wayne were able to get a modal popup working when users click on a level, but they are having issues with formatting, specifically with rendering the bitmoji at the correct size. Next week they will fix these formatting issues with Bitmoji. Kip, Allen, and I updated the team on our struggles with Async storage, which we will continue working on next week. Kip and I talked about our attempts at rendering a customizable Bitmoji using Libmoji (see yesterday’s post) which we will continue working on next week. If we are not able to get the customizable Libmoji render working, we may need to scrap the Bitmoji idea and go for a simpler character design. Speaking of design, Elissa was able to join our meeting today! Her job seems to be winding down, so if she has time this week, she may design some backgrounds for our quest screen. I’m excited to see what she comes up with :).

                  Today Kip and I struggled with Libmoji for the duration of our work session. A consistent problem with Libmoji seems to be the lack of documentation. The aspect of Libmoji we are working with is the traits, which allows users to customize their character’s basic traits like hair, skin color, and facial features. The problem we are running into is with the formatting. Libmoji has a function that pulls the traits called getTraits(). The problem is that the input to this function has to be a Trait object, but we have no way to see what a Trait object should really look like or how to initialize a Trait object. We tried printing a Trait object using the given Libmoji randTrait() function, but it just printed a Javascript array. When we tried printing the type of a trait object, it just returned ‘object’ which was too generic to learn any additional information from. We tried all sorts of syntactic variations on Javascript arrays by moving brackets and commas into different grouping, but nothing seemed to work. The possible values for different traits and their customizations are stored in a JSON file. So, our next approach was to try different methods of pulling values directly from the JSON file, and then transforming those values to Javascript, leaving it as JSON, etc. None of these attempts yielded any successful results. Eventually, we just used a long URL template that was provided to render the Bitmoji. While this works for rendering in a specific Bitmoji, it doesn’t seem very scalable or intuitive for allowing users to customize their character. Kip and I will have to look more into how we can change the URL implementation or keep working on formatting to pull the traits from the JSON file so that it’s more scalable for customization.

                  Today has been a busy day for our Gamified Task Manager! This morning Kip and I fully implemented the change UserID functionality and started working on the character screen using Libmoji. We had our weekly team meeting today where we discussed a lot of important logistics for how the levels will work and what components will need to be in Async Storage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Kip and I’s first item of business was to fix some git issues that popped up when I tried to compile the app. I was still running into some version mismatch errors between javascript and React Native. Kip advised that it would be best to just delete and re-clone the version from github onto my device. The problem was likely coming from package.json version mismatches, so re-cloning the whole fixed this error. Kip also merged the changes from the branch that Allen and I made yesterday. Since our branch was not throwing any errors, according to our new git practices, we wanted to merge this new branch. At this point, our app was compiling and was up to date with all the features Allen and I implemented yesterday.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Next, Kip and I worked on the change user ID functionality. We used React Native’s ‘Alert.prompt’ feature to implement an alert that allows users to input text for their new user ID. From here, we made sure that the input from the user was saved as the new user ID using our existing Async storage functions. We spent some time adding a console.log that printed the new userID to make sure that the ID was being correctly saved and stored.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lastly, we started working on the Character screen. Previously, I found a react native library called Libmoji. This allows us to implement Bitmojis without users having an existing Bitmoji account so that our app is accessible to all users. We spent most of our time today reading through the Libmoji documentation and trying to familiarize ourselves with the different features in Libmoji. At the end we were able to render a randomly generated bitmoji onto the top half of our character screen. The bottom half will be used for the clothing inventory. In the coming weeks, Kip and I will try and work more with Libmoji to see if we can use it for our app purposes. However, the documentation for Libmoji is not very complete, so it may prove to be more challenging than anticipated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Following Kip and I’s work session, we had our team meeting with Allen and Wayne. Since Allen and Wayne are pretty far along with the Quest Screen, we started talking about more of the logistics of how the app works. In our last meeting we agreed that our theme would be traveling the world and collecting clothes. Based on the limitations of Bitmoji’s clothing options, we may not be able to implement the ‘travel’ aspect as much as we want. :( We agreed that for now we would assign Task points for each task completed. Once a user has enough task points they can unlock quest levels and collect clothing items from that level. Wayne brought up the idea of weighted tasks, which I think would make our app more interesting and encourage users to complete more tasks. One way we might implement weighted tasks is by assigning them as ‘Very Important’, ‘Important’, ‘Should Do’, and ‘If Time’. Then users can place their tasks in the appropriate categories and we’ll assign weights based on the category. However, this is a Should/Could Have item and not a Must Have item, so for now we will stick with the same weight for each task. We also talked about how as the levels progress, we could increase the amount of task points needed to unlock each level. But again, this is something that we will implement once we have a functioning prototype, so for now we will stick with the same number of points to unlock each level. We also agreed that when users collect the required amount of task points, the next level will automatically unlock, but in order to collect the clothing item from that level, the user has to click the level on the quest screen and click to collect the item. For now we will just have one assigned item that the user gets per level, but with this clickable implementation, it wouldn’t be too difficult to expand the implementation to let users choose between multiple clothing options when unlocking each level later on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Next, we talked through each subteam’s progress and next steps. Allen and Wayne were able to add a background, but unfortunately it seems like using interactive images won’t be possible for our app. They also implemented chapters to break up groups of levels. Next week they plan to make the levels clickable and look into how they might pull level numbers out of Async storage. Allen updated the team on our progress with the Todo screen (see yesterday’s post for details) where we now have edit and cross out/check off functionality. Next week, we will work on incrementing XP by a set amount when a task is checked off and updating the amount of XP in Async storage so that other screens like the Top Nav bar and Quest screen can use the information. We also want to be able to calculate the level number based on total XP collected. Kip and I talked through how we finished implementing the change user ID functionality and how we are now able to render random Bitmojis. Next week Kip and I will work on pulling information from Async storage to display the correct progress level on our Top Navigation progress bar. We will also implement a display for what level the user is at on our Top Navigation. Lastly, we will work more with Libmoji to see if there is a way to customize a Bitmoji’s features like eye shape, hair color, etc. instead of rendering random Bitmojis.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During this week in particular, each of the subteams made pretty significant progress towards a functioning prototype, and as each screen gets closer to completion we will have to start thinking about how the screens come together. As the screens interact more, we’ll work more with Async storage and our weekly meetings will discuss more detailed next steps. I’m excited to see what we can accomplish for next week!

                  Allen and I were able to get a lot done with the Task List screen’s functionality today! Kip wasn’t able to make it, but we updated her using screen recordings in our group chat and we’ll update her and Wayne on our progress in more detail during tomorrow’s team meeting. Our main approach for today was to go back to the tutorial we originally followed when we first started working on the To Do List. This would allow us to fix our issues with editing tasks, which was our main concern for the week. From there, we worked on reimplementing the feature that allows users to cross out/check off completed tasks, since the original tutorial did not include this functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our first step was to directly reference the tutorial’s functions and implementations for editing. We reverted the changes we made to the edit functions and we used the tutorial’s system for editing tasks. This is where users click a button to start editing a task and click another button to save their edits. This worked pretty smoothly with the exception of some formatting issues, which we fixed by rearranging View containers. We previously discussed before that we did not want to have a separate button for editing text (which is what the tutorial had). Instead, we wanted users to be able to click the text directly to edit it. This implementation avoids the clutter of too many buttons and is similar to how other apps work, so it should be relatively intuitive for users. This was a relatively easy change to make. We moved the onPress function originally assigned to the edit button and reassigned it to the text of each task. We deleted the now redundant edit button. We needed to keep the save button since there were specific functions that need to be called once a user finishes editing their task in order to save their changes. The save button only appears when a user is editing a task and disappears once the user presses the save button so thankfully it does not contribute to any clutter of having too many buttons.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Next, we needed to reimplement the feature that allowed users to cross out/check off completed tasks and get rid of our automatic moving feature, since we deemed it unnecessary for our end-of-summer basic prototype. The original tutorial was not compatible with our cross out/check off functionality, so we made some changes that mirrored the changes we originally made to first implement the cross out/check off function before trying to add automatic moving. This mainly consisted of adding a property to each item that indicated whether the item was completed or not and removing some variables that would be redundant with this new property. We kept a lot of the same ideas from our previous implementation since we knew it had worked before. After some debugging, we eventually got the cross out/check off feature working again! This time the cross/out/check off functionality is compatible with our editing feature, which was our main goal for this week.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We spent some time at the end formatting the save button’s position, changing some colors to be more in line with our app’s color palette, and fixing some minor overlapping. Also notable is that Kip was successful in rebuilding the app last Sunday after our team meeting and she added some great documentation for creating new branches. This was really helpful for Allen and I when we were developing today! We didn’t need to worry about messing things up on the developer branch, since we were working on our own separate branch. Additionally, since Kip rebuilt the app onto an older and thus more stable version of React Native, we no longer had the errors with Touchable Opacity’s ‘Focus’ and ‘Blur’ properties which was a great relief. The work that Kip has done was greatly appreciated and very helpful for this week’s development and for long-term future development. :)
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tomorrow, Kip and I will work on the Settings screen and start thinking about the Character screen. Following that, we will have our team meeting where we can catch up on our progress. I’m excited to share what we accomplished with the To Do List screen and maybe we can work on the Habits screen next!

                  Today we had a pretty quick meeting, but we addressed a lot of important topics. Our first item was deciding between the clothes theme and the food theme. I personally was leaning toward the clothes theme. After thinking about the pros and cons of each theme, I think the audience for the food theme is too niche and might not reach our target audience. Our food theme idea (where users can unlock recipes) relies on our audience enjoying cooking and being willing to follow recipes, being an adventurous eater who wants to try new foods, and having the ingredients that the recipes require. On the other hand, the clothing theme would allow us to reach anyone who is interested in clothes or character customization, which encompasses a larger audience and more of our intended audience. What makes our app unique is that it ‘gamifies’ in a way that is different from the stereotypically masculine gamified task managers currently on the market.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once we decided on the clothing theme, we were able to discuss the layout and components of our character screen. Once Kip and I finish the userID update feature, we will get started on developing the character customization screen, but we wanted to ask the team for ideas of what this screen should include. We plan to use a similar layout to other character customization screens where you view your character on the majority of the screen but you have a menu of your inventory of clothing/customization options. The menu is split up by categories (ex: hats, shirts, jackets, pants, shoes, etc.) that users can view one at a time. Since we are using a mobile layout, we will put this menu at the bottom of the screen to take advantage of the vertical layout. We plan to implement characters using Bitmoji for now, since Elissa is taking a break from visual design. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Next, we talked about some general code change procedures. Up to this point, when subteams run into errors coming from other screens members will often comment out the other screens, but this can be frustrating when the next subteam has to comb through and uncomment the screens they want to work on. We talked about subteams uncommenting any screens that they may have commented out at the end of the work session and raising issues they’ve encountered in the groupchat. We also discussed that we were moving from npm to yarn for our libraries, since it is generally faster and less overwhelming. Kip mentioned that she will try rebuilding the app on an older, more stable version of React Native to try and fix our dependency issues. Currently, React is in version 0.63.0, but since this is a .0 version, there are many bugs that come with new features. Kip brought up that an older version will be more stable, which is our priority at this point. We will also change our git practices to create branches for each sub team's features to avoid the issue of commenting and uncommenting screens between teams. This should lead to a more sustainable workflow. :)
                </p>
                <p>
                  We also discussed how if we run into dependency issues or other larger issues in our subteams, we can bring them up in our group chat. If we are not able to resolve them, we will have allotted times to work through issues during our weekly meeting. Hopefully, this will help us move more smoothly and debug errors more efficiently. Working through the issues as a team ensures that everyone is on the same page and it allows everyone to contribute and see how more complicated  errors can be resolved.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, we caught up on our progress from last week and what we plan to do this week. Allen and Wayne have made progress with the Quest screen in showing the current level that the user is on using check marks. They are currently using a grid layout to display the levels and are considering storing the level progress in async storage. Next week, they plan to look into interactive images for moving between different chapters/clusters of levels as well as general background images. Kip talked about where we are stuck with the Task List screen (see yesterday’s post for details). I brought up pausing on the automatic moving function since we have been struggling with it for a few weeks and changing the appearance of completed tasks is more important. Automatic moving is a ‘should have’ function while crossing out completed tasks is a ‘must have’ function. We agreed that we can put automatic moving on the back burner, especially so we can focus on getting the edit feature working. Kip and I talked about how we have a functioning ‘back’ button for our Character and Settings screen and talked through our progress with the Settings screen’s change userID function (see Friday’s post for details). We brought up how text input alerts aren’t always compatible with Android, but as a team we agreed that we can just worry about IOS for now. Next week, Kip and I will finish implementing the text input alert for the change userID function. We will also start working on a template for the Character screen and do some research on how to implement Bitmojis for our characters. It seems like we’re getting closer and closer to a functioning prototype!

                  Allen, Kip, and I worked on the Task List Screen fow a while, but we weren’t able to make much progress. At the beginning, we fixed some simple errors with deleting old imports and removing old unnecessary screens from the very beginning phases of this project. Most of our issues will need to be brought up in tomorrow’s meeting before we proceed, since we’re a little stuck at the moment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our main task today was trying to fix the automatic moving feature (where completed tasks move to the bottom of the list and uncompleted tasks move to the top of the list) so that it worked alongside changing the appearance of completed tasks (crossed out, checked box, and grayed out). Last week we were having issues since we wanted to return two changes of state but were only able to return one in our onPress function. Today, we tried to tackle this issue by changing the ‘completed’ state without the onPress function and only change the state of the items’ position using onPress. To do this, we used setState within the function called by onPress and changed the property ‘completed’ after onPress was called. While this definitely cleaned up our methods and removed code duplication, this did not resolve our issue. Tasks are still able to automatically move to the top or bottom of the list, but the appearance does not change. I think that we might come back to the automatic moving feature if we can’t get past it. While it would be very nice to have and would help usability, the to do list is still functional without it. I’ll bring this up in tomorrow’s meeting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We also tried to fix our editing functionality. Since the tutorial that we initially followed had an edit button, we used the existing functions that allowed for editing, but tried to implement it for when users click on the text instead of clicking on a separate button. By removing the button and just allowing users to click on the text, we hoped to keep the appearance more streamlined and avoid confusing users with too many symbols for buttons. Essentially, we moved the original onPress call to an onPress call for the user’s text. This worked to some extent. It seems like clicking the text allows for editing, but there are a lot of intermediate warnings and errors about ‘Focus’ and ‘Blur’ that also show up when trying to add new tasks. We tried troubleshooting this by using ‘Pressable’ instead of ‘TouchableOpacity’ but we still got the same error messages. We think these errors might be due to version mismatches between Javascript and React Native or due to incorrect dependencies within our libraries. We plan to talk through these errors in our next meeting, since it seems like multiple subteams are running into dependency issues. :(

                  Today Kip and I made some really good progress with implementing the back buttons and the settings screen. :) Initially we had some issues with navigating to the Character Screen and Settings Screen from the top navigation. It seems like during one of our work sessions either with the navigation or with the task list, we had deleted the Character Screen and the Settings Screen from the stack navigator while we were deleting the Habits Screen, Task Screen, and Quest Screen from the stack navigator. The Habits, Task, and Quest screens are loaded with the bottom navigation bar, so they don’t need to be loaded in the stack navigation, but since Character and Settings are loaded separately, they need to be included in the stack navigator. Additionally, there are some dependency issues with the swiping functionality for the bottom navigation, so we have temporarily disabled swipe. While swiping between screens is a nice feature to have, it’s not totally necessary for the functionality of our app. Given the current state of the app, we will worry about reimplementing the swipe functionality once we have a fully functional initial prototype.

                  Next, we worked on adding back buttons to the Character and Settings screen. This ended up being pretty straightforward since there is an existing navigation.goback() function that we could use. We ended up implementing the back button by placing an icon in the top left corner of the screen with an onPress function that called navigation.goback(). We spent some time messing around with the formatting so that the button was large enough, in the safe area view, and with an appropriate icon. With this button added to both the Settings and Character screen, it should be more intuitive for users to navigate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lastly, we worked on the Settings screen’s functionality. We started by discussing what we actually wanted the screen’s layout to look like. We decided to model our settings screen off of Apple, Instagram, and Snapchat’s settings screen. Since this layout is standard across many apps, it should be more intuitive for users to navigate. This layout has rows with text describing each setting aligned left with a right chevron aligned right end if that setting navigates to a screen. Currently, the only setting we can actually implement is changing the user ID. Since this is such a simple setting to change, we thought it would be unnecessary to navigate to a new screen. Instead, we opted to have an alert pop up where users can type in and save a new username. We were able to get the alert pop up working, but have not implemented the text input functionality. Something we will keep in mind is that alerts with text inputs are not consistently compatible for Android. Our whole app team uses iPhones so we may need to reach out to someone with an android device to check our app’s functionality. Next week, Kip and I will finish up the implementation for changing userIDs. We will also start tackling the Character Screen. As a team, we haven’t discussed the details of what the Character screen will look like, so we plan to bring this up at the next meeting so we know what to work on next time.

                  This morning Kip, Allen, and I worked on the TaskScreen for a few hours. We wanted to implement the feature that would automatically move completed tasks to the bottom of the list when checked off and automatically move tasks to the top of the list if unchecked. We  implemented this by rerendering the task items in the desired order by filtering and adding the newly checked or unchecked item in the appropriate places. We were able to get the automatic movement aspect working, but unfortunately this made it so that the appearance of completed tasks was not changing. For example, completed tasks would move to the bottom of the list, but the text would not be crossed off and the box would not be checked. We struggled with this issue and tried to troubleshoot by changing the order, combining functions, and separating functions. Unfortunately, we were not able to resolve this issue today, but we will continue to work on it next week.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Immediately after our work session, we had our team meeting, since unfortunately Wayne was not able to make it. Something I’m excited about is that we implemented a new backlog system! On Friday, I thought it might be helpful to bring up this suggestion to the group based on the system used in my Fidelity team. It’s rewarding to see how I can apply what I’ve learned in my internships to my own personal projects. :) We decided that the best way to organize this system was a table where the rows were the screens and the columns were the Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won’t Have categories (explained in the July 3rd entry). We spent some time writing out features for each screen and each category. I think this will give us a better idea of the big picture in terms of what features we need to prioritize completing and what we can come back to. Our meeting today generated some great preliminary ideas of what Must/Should/Could/Won’t be included in our app, but I think that as each subteam continues to work on their screens, they will be able to flesh out the table more as they come up with new ideas for features that they might want to add. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  As we talked through some ideas in our backlog, we also pivoted to a discussion about the themes in our app. We were initially thinking about using character customization as our main theme and motivator in the quest portion of the app, but in our last meeting we brainstormed the idea of incorporating cultural foods. We thought we could have users unlock recipes as they move through different countries and regions of the world. Today, we had some back-and-forth discussion about the details of what this might look like. While we weren't able to come to a complete agreement on the nitty-gritty, together we brainstormed a lot of interesting ideas and have agreement on the general format of incorporating food by unlocking a recipe in each country. We can explore further and work through the specifics of the food theme when the time comes. We currently have pretty complete ideas for a clothes theme and a food theme, but it would be too ambitious to try and implement both, so at some point we will need to decide on one or the other. The main thing we will consider when choosing a theme is our target audience, but this is something that we can decide on when we have more of the functional components working and when more of the team is present. For now, I’m satisfied with what we’ve brainstormed for both ideas and I honestly don’t have a strong preference for either clothes or food as motivators, since they both tie into our main theme of traveling and learning about new cultures. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our last item for today was going through each subcomponent team’s progress and next steps. Allen and Wayne have been testing the Login screen on different devices to make sure it is compatible with whatever device our users have. They also started working on the quest screen, which already has a basic template! The Login screen seems mostly done, but Allen mentioned that she and Wayne will continue working on the Quest screen next week. For the TaskScreen, our main focus for next week will be getting the automatic moving feature that we implemented this week to work with changing the appearance of completed tasks. If we have time, we will also work on reimplementing the edit feature. Kip and I talked about what we accomplished for the bottom navigation in terms of updating the appearance and components. We also talked about how we completed a functional template for the top navigation. Our next steps will be adding a back button for the settings and character screens so that users can easily get back to the main page. If we have time, we may also start working on the settings screen. So far, the only component we can think of adding to the settings screen is changing the userID, but as we work we may have more ideas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This week, we made a lot of good progress with implementing Async storage, creating a top functional navigation bar, and creating a backlog to organize our features. I’m excited to start working on new screens like the settings screen and to continue to brainstorm themes. We’ve hit a bit of a roadblock with naming our app since we still haven’t decided if we want to implement clothing customization or unlock recipes, but I’ve enjoyed hearing everyone’s ideas during our brainstorming sessions and I think we’re not far off from coming up with a really unique app idea. :)

                  This morning Kip and I worked for about two hours on creating a template for our top statistics/navigation bar and fixing up the bottom navigation bar. Initially, we wanted to create the top navigation bar using createMaterialTopNav like we had done to create the bottom navigation bar previously. However, since we wanted to include a progress bar in the middle, which wouldn’t navigate to a new screen, we decided to just create icons with onPress navigation to our Character and Settings screens. We also weren’t sure if we would face issues with having two navigation bars on the same screen, so implementing our top navigation in this way would also avoid this problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Initially, we faced a lot of problems with getting the top navigation bar to be visible on the screen. Our first approach was similar to how we implemented our bottom navigation using stack navigator and importing screens, but for some reason this was not working. We messed around with moving it’s position on the stack navigator, importing screens, and deleting screens. We found out that if we hid the bottom navigation, we could see our top navigation bar. For the sake of being able to work on the template, we temporarily commented out the other screens so we could see the top navigation. Using a lot of the insights from last week’s TaskList work session regarding adding containers and flexbox properties, we were able to correctly format the icons for the character screen, progress bar, and settings screen onto the same line with the desired screen. Once we were happy with the formatting, we had to go back to fixing the issue of not being able to see the top navigation when the bottom navigation. Kip came up with the idea of loading the top navigation in the bottom navigation screen, to avoid the problem of only being able to see one at a time. This worked as desired and we were able to have the top and bottom navigation at the same time and both functional! We were able to add the onPress navigation to the Character and Settings screen using onPress and navigation.navigate so that users could click on the icons and be directed to the right screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We also spent a few minutes fixing up our bottom navigation since we had moved the settings and character screens to the top navigation. We also added a ‘Habits’ page to the bottom navigation and found a corresponding icon. In terms of next steps, we might need to implement a button to go back to the original screens from the Character and Settings screens. Currently, users can only navigate back to the main app from the Character and Settings screens by swiping left, but this might not be very intuitive. We also might be able to start working on the settings screen next week or in the near future, which might include features like changing user ID or color schemes.

                  Today Kip, Allen, Wayne, and I met up to work through some issues with Async storage. Allen and Wayne have been primarily working with this issue, so they started off the meeting by sharing what they had tried and what they were having issues with. Next, we compiled some articles that walked through how to use Async storage with React Native and tried following along with these tutorials. We ran into quite a few obstacles along the way, but ultimately, with some tweaks, new dependencies, and new files we were able to figure out how to use Async storage to save a user ID. Hopefully this will help Allen and Wayne with their Login screen progress, and we can apply the same ideas of Async storage to other aspects of the app like coins, quests, characters, etc. so that our app works in the way that we want.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The last step was to run some tests to make sure we were correctly saving the userID and that we would be able to retrieve the userID when needed. We had some trouble with this portion initially since AsyncStorage returns objects as promises, so we were not able to see the userID as a string. Eventually, using await and .getItem(), we were able to create an alert that welcomes the user to the app using their userID! We probably won’t have this alert in the final app, but this is a good way to test that the userID is stored and retrievable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today I also realized that it might be useful to apply some of the project management strategies that I’ve learned through my Fidelity internship to this project. In my internship, my team uses a backlog to keep track of features to implement during their Agile sprints. Our app project doesn’t use sprints, but I think that organizing a backlog of features that have yet to be implemented could be helpful. The backlog is organized according to the MoSCoW Prioritization, which has 4 categories: Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won’t Have. Must Haves are items that are vital in order for the product to be considered successful/functional. For our app, these would be the minimum features that we would need for our prototype by the end of the summer. Should Haves are items that are high-priority but not essential. So for our app these would be the items that make our app unique and would be the first things we would work on adding to the prototype, but are not essential for functionality. Could Haves are items that would be nice or are desirable, but are not necessary for the app. These features might be included in the first updates of our app. Won’t Haves are items that were brainstormed but may end up being rejected because they aren’t feasible or no longer align with the vision of our app. I’m planning to bring up MoSCoW prioritization during Sunday’s meeting and seeing what the rest of the team thinks.

                  Today we had a bit of a smaller meeting than usual. Allen and I brainstormed some names, but weren’t able to make a lot of progress from last week and felt a bit stuck. When Wayne showed up, we decided to brainstorm themes for the app or components of the app. We thought that having a more solid theme idea might help us find a direction for brainstorming names instead of just having basic names about “List” or “Task.” We were able to come up with quite a few themes surrounding travel, customization, and animals. Next week when we have more of the team together, we might expand on some of these themes and ideas or narrow down which ones we think best fits the vision for our app. Once we have a theme, we hope to have more productive and creative brainstorming ideas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Next we went around and updated as well as we could for the different components. Allen and Wayne have fixed the ‘Next’ button! This means that users can navigate from the home screen to the main app. However, while this works on Allen’s phone, we found that it doesn’t show up on other devices. Allen and Wayne will look into what is causing this issue, but they suspect that it is because of the hardcoded top and bottom margins. Allen and I talked about our progress on the Task List screen with moving the checkbox to the left of the task and implementing a ‘Remove’ button for each task. We also mentioned that we weren’t able to implement the automatic moving of the text for completed tasks and that the edit feature isn't working. I provided updates on me and Kip’s progress with implementing the swipeable navigation. I also mentioned that I added a hand-drawn template for the top naviagtion bar in our Visual Documentation, but we weren’t able to complete a template in code. I brought up the idea of swiping down to get to the view character screen to bring more emphasis to the character customization aspect of the app and it seems like Allen and Wayne are on board with the idea, so I will look into ways to implement this further down the line.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Allen brought up our Visual Documentation folder to make sure that we were keeping track of our app progress as we continued working on the app. We also discussed some tips or advice for working remotely together. Mainly, we wanted to make sure that subteam members were being vocal about changes they were making to the code or what they were researching during team meetings to make sure that everyone is on the same page.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We briefly reiterated what we planned to do next week. Allen and Wayne will make sure that the ‘Next’ button is visible on all screen sizes. The Task List subteam will work on fixing ‘Edit’ functionality and implementing the feature that moves completed tasks to the bottom of the list. Kip and I will create a template for the top naviagtion bar. Since we don’t yet have a View Character or Settings screen, we will create placeholder screens so that we can test that the buttons lead to the correct screens. Although the subteams are making good progress with these current screens, there are still quite a few screens that we haven’t started working on yet. We may have to start implementing these screens pretty soon in order to have a functioning prototype by the end of the summer. Allen and Wayne mentioned that they could start working on the Quest Screen once they finish the Home Screen. Kip and I will start working on the Settings Screen once the Navigation components are finished. Our Task List subteam will work on the Habits page once we have finished the main To Do Screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An issue that we have run into a couple of times is Async storage. Since this component will appear in quite a few parts of our app, we feel that we should all be involved in this process. Allen and Wayne have primarily been working through our storage issues thus far. They will fill us in on what has and hasn’t worked so far with what they’ve tried. We plan to meet next Saturday to hopefully make some progress and talk through the issues. Excited for more progress next week and the possibility of getting started on new screens!

                  Last night, Kip was able to fix the dependency issues with the packages by reinstalling all the necessary packages. :) With these issues fixed, we were able to get working on what we had set out to work during our last meeting. Our aim for this session was to move the check box to the left of the task text and implement a button to allow users to delete tasks. This setup is similar to how other apps allow users to add and delete items, so hopefully this setup will make it more intuitive for users.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first step was to move the checkbox from the left side of the text to the right side of the text. This proved to be a bit more challenging than we originally anticipated. The first, most straightforward step to move the position of the checkbox’s code to be before the text’s code. Since React Native renders items left to right, this would move the checkbox item to the left of the text as desired.  However, this led to some problems with flexbox widths. Somehow, the boxes had expanded to the full width of the screen, which meant that the checkbox and the text were left-aligned on separate lines. It took quite a while of experimenting with flexboxes and different parameters like flex-wrap, justifyContent, flex-direction, align-items, align-content, etc. Eventually, we were able to create appropriately sized boxes by hard-coding widths and putting an additional container around the text boxes to control the size of it’s flexbox without affecting the layout of the text. With the correctly sized text boxes, we were able to move the checkbox button and the text onto the same line using flex-direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our next step was to create a button that allows users to delete tasks from their list using an ‘X’ button. The tutorial that we worked off of last week included a function for a delete button, so we were able to re-implement this button pretty quickly and easily. Lastly, we translated our hardcoded widths to flex values in order to make our layout more flexible to different sizes of screens without running into formatting issues. We also quickly made some aesthetic changes regarding colors and spacing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We discovered that the edit feature was no longer functioning after we made our changes today. This will be our first priority for next week since it's an essential part of our Task list’s functionality. I’m not quite sure what happened between last week and this week, but we’ll look more into this next week. Unfortunately, we weren’t able to implement the feature where completed tasks move to the bottom of the list automatically or allow users to move the items manually. We may try to get completed tasks to move to the bottom of the list next week, since this is pretty important in terms of usability.

                  Today Allen, Kip, and I worked for about an hour on the Task List screen, but weren’t able to make much progress. :( Unfortunately, we kept getting error messages about incorrect or unfound packages and dependencies. We spent a lot of time trying to debug but with no luck. Kip said that she would look into the errors and we’ll reconvene tomorrow morning.

                  A short navbar update entry for today. Kip and I worked on implementing the swipe feature to the bottom navigation bar for about an hour and talked through some items for the top naviagtion bar. We worked based on the tutorial found last Saturday and though there were a couple obstacles, it was pretty straightforward!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Initially, we had implemented the navigation bar using createBottomTabNavigation (from two weeks ago). This allowed us to create a clickable bottom navigation bar, but did not allow for swiping. We tried to see if we could implement swiping using creatBottomTabNavigation or even with createMaterialBottomTabNavigation for a while, but did not have any luck. It turns out that in order to have a swipeable bottom navigation bar, we needed to use createMaterialTopTabNavigation and specify that placement should be at the bottom. Admittedly, this seems a little messy, but createMaterialBottomTabNavigation does not allow for swiping. :( The ‘Material’ aspect of the createMaterialTopTabNavigation also allows for the animation of sliding screens when swiping. With the swiping functionality enabled, users still have the functionality to click the buttons on the bottom navigation bar to get to different screens. Once functional, to keep the navigation bar clean, we decided to remove the labels and only display icons on the navigation bar. Since there are only 3 screens and we will display the name at the top of each screen, we felt that the labels were unnecessary. After some quick formatting changes, we finished up our new swipeable bottom navigation bar. :)
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the last part of our meeting, we talked about the top naviagtion bar. Unfortunately, we did not have time to implement the top naviagtion bar template, but since none of the screens or elements for the top naviagtion bar have been started yet and we are finished with the bottom navigation bar, we should  have plenty of time to work on the top naviagtion bar next week. I also brought up being able to swipe down to get to the view character screen and we agreed we could bring it up on Sunday’s meeting to get the rest of the team’s thoughts.

                  Another productive team meeting! We started off by catching up on what each subteam was up to. Allen and Wayne talked about how they tried to change the format of the LogIn Screen to allow navigation onto a different screen using a ‘Next’ button. Since it didn’t really work, they plan to continue working on it this week. They were also able to fix the text box, so that it correctly underlines the user’s name. They mentioned that they looked more into asynchronous storage, but without much luck. Allen, Kip, and I talked about what we accomplished this week with the Check/Uncheck functionality and what we still needed to accomplish with moving tasks around and implementing a ‘Habits’ page (see yesterday’s post for more details!). Kip and I brought up what we discussed for the top naviagtion bar. As a group we agreed that we would have our ‘View Character’ button in the left corner with an image of the user’s avatar as the icon; we would have our settings in the right corner; we would have some way to measure progress or view inventory in the middle. We are thinking that we can measure progress with collecting coins or a general progress bar. Unfortunately, Elissa was not able to make it to today’s meeting, but she mentioned that she worked on separating the avatar into clean katers so that each layer can be changed differently and layered smoothly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a team, we also brainstormed some ideas for collection items and themes so that we are ready to start prototyping quest elements when the time comes. We are thinking of just using coins for our functional prototype for simplicity’s sake, and we can change from coins to some other item later on. As mentioned in a previous entry, we were thinking that users earn coins from completing tasks. There was some discussion about if these coins would be used to directly buy quests and buy items or if users would unlock quests once they had enough coins and win items from those unlocked quests. For the second option, in order to keep the customization element of the app, we were thinking of allowing users to choose from 3 options of items to unlock instead of just giving them a specified item for each quest unlocked. We then talked about what we wanted for our quest format. We mentioned a storyline initially and we were thinking that the quests could move through different countries or regions of the world. I really like this idea since it allows users to explore diverse cultures and shows representations of many different parts of the world. This might allow users to learn new things through our app as well! :)
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some other topics we discussed were design research and storage options. Allen proposed that we look into popular apps and see if we are inspired by some of those features. For example, we liked the swipe navigation found on Snapchat and Tinder. Looking into other apps for features that we enjoy might allow us to make our app more user-friendly. Allen and Wayne also brought up Firebase as a storage option, since it seems easier to implement and use. I don’t know much about Firebase, but I can definitely look into it more on my own time. We spent a little while brainstorming names and came up with some fun options, but we aren’t totally sure about a name yet. We will likely continue having 5-10 minute brainstorming sessions every week during our meetings!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, we talked about what we wanted to improve or incorporate into each subteam’s component for the coming week. Allen and Wayne mentioned working on the ‘Next’ button and the Firebase storage for the LogIn screen. Our Task List subteam will work on automatically moving completed tasks to the bottom of the list and adding a delete button. If we have time, we can work on allowing users to move tasks on their own and adding the habits page, otherwise we will implement this further down the line. Kip and I will work on the swipe functionality since it seems relatively straightforward to implement. We will also work on a template/preliminary version of the top nav bar. I’m excited to keep working on the app and see what progress we can make for next week!

                  Today most of the progress was with the TaskScreen portion of the app. Allen, Kip, and I met for about 2-3 hours to work on the TaskScreen. Allen found a tutorial online that had a lot of useful information about how to make a shopping list app. We were able to apply a lot of ideas from this tutorial to our To Do List screen. From the tutorial we were able to fix our text input problem, so now we have a fully functioning button where users can type in their tasks and add it to the todo list! The tutorial’s template also fixed our issue from last week where the list items were just text boxes. Now, each list item appears as a separate object with its own properties. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once we had the list items, we wanted to make some alterations for what happens when you complete a task. The original/tutorial version would just allow users to delete the task once they were finished, but we thought it would be more rewarding and thus more motivating if users were able to check off tasks without deleting them so they could see how many tasks they were finishing. We spent the majority of today’s meeting implementing a check box. When the user clicks an empty check box to signify that they have completed the task, then the box becomes checked and the text is grayed and struck through. Users can also uncheck boxes to ‘un-complete’ them, which returns the text to its original state and returns the box to its empty state. We had some confusion due to repeated variable names and unclearly named functions, but once we had a better grasp of what each function and variable’s purpose was, we were able to get our code running smoothly!
                </p>
                <p>
                  An additional feature that we would like to add is that when the user completes a task it should automatically move to the bottom of the list. We think this will keep the screen organized and allow users to easily keep track of which tasks they still need to complete, while still being able to see their progress and how many tasks they have completed. We would also like to allow users to move tasks around so that they can organize the list in a format that they like or in the order that they plan to complete the tasks. We also need to re-implement the ability to delete tasks in case users want to remove tasks from the list. We may implement a button that clears all completed tasks as well. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additionally, today we talked about how we might want to make a habits page in addition to our to do list. If there are tasks that users need to complete every day, then it may be tedious to re-input those tasks every day, so we want to make a different page that refreshes the same ‘habit’ tasks each day. Additionally, we want to implement a feature that keeps track of how many days in a row that the habits have been completed. This ‘streaks’ feature would be a good motivator for users to keep up daily habits. We may do this with a calendar feature like Fitbit’s daily exercise tracking feature. Once we finish implementing the todo list page we will work on the habits page since it will have similar features to our to do list page that we can build off of.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today I also found a source that shows how to implement swipe functionality to a navbar. Kip and I can try implementing this swipe feature next week. This week we have spent time thinking about what we might want for a top naviagtion bar. Since our app has quest features, we want to implement a way for users to see their progress which would live at the top of the screen. Since we are adding a habits screen, we want to move the ‘view character’ feature to be part of the top navigation so that we can keep our 3-screen plan, while still allowing users to quickly access and customize their character. The top navigation is also where we would put our settings bar. I am also thinking about how we might consider using a swipe down feature for viewing the character, since just having a small button to view the character might de-emphasize the character customization aspect of the app. These are all things that we will discuss with the team tomorrow.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lastly, today I spent some time individually brainstorming app names, but most of the names are pretty basic and don’t stand out or emphasize why our app is different from exiting task managers, like ListQuest or TaskList. I think that it might be easier to brainstorm names as a group and talk through some ideas. Looking forward to seeing the group’s progress tomorrow!

                  In today’s meeting we caught up on the progress from our subgroups and started talking about how we might piece our components together. I’ll give a quick walkthrough of where we are with each screen. Wayne and Allen have started on the home screen and have some basic functionality done, which is exciting! The user can enter their name and scroll to choose an ‘avatar’ (currently just some placeholder pictures). We plan to have this screen show up only when the user opens the app for the first time. Then Kip updated the group on where out subteam is regarding the task screen (Read Friday’s entry to read the details of our status). Next, I updated the group on where Kip and I got in terms of the navbar (read Saturday’s entry for details on that). Lastly, Elissa updated us on the current status of the character design. We’ve decided to go with a chibi-style character template and the design that Elissa shared looks great!
                </p>
                <p>
                  The next item of the meeting was a quick note on React dependencies from Kip. This was just to make sure that everyone knew that we need to run npm install when we pull from github since we use different libraries. She also drew our attention to the fact that we should be careful about noting the difference between React and React Native.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Next was the exciting part! We got to talk about how we might pull our components together into the cohesive app. We agreed that for our 3 screens, we wanted to have the Todo list in the center as the first thing that users would see when they logged in, and then have the quest and character screens on either side. We also talked about having the ability to swipe between screens in addition to using the navbar, similar to the way that Snapchat is formatted. We agreed that while this would be a nice feature to have, it was not an immediate priority, since our goal currently is to have a functioning prototype, and we will add the bells and whistles later. For now, we have the functioning navbar that Kip and I created, and if we are able to complete a functioning prototype before the end of summer, Kip and I can work on this additional feature. Lastly, we decided on a color scheme. We have chosen to keep a generally white background, with pastel pinks, purples, and blues. We talked about how we might implement the ‘dark mode’ option later on, since a lot of users prefer dark mode. Again, since this is not an essential feature, we will add this if after we get an initial functioning prototype. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lastly, we determined what we wanted to do before the next meeting. We will continue working in our subgroups from last week to continue to improve our tools. Allen and Wayne talked about how they will be adding a screen where users can customize their avatars, continue fixing up the makeProfile screen, and add an alert that navigates users to the main screen. Our tasklist subteam will continue working on the mechanism for adding new tasks and work towards getting a functioning prototype. Kip and I are happy with where the NavBar’s functionality is currently, but we will spend some time individually researching how to implement the swipe feature so that if we get the opportunity to work past a functional prototype, we will be more prepared to implement it. Elissa plans to continue working on character design and I’m excited to see what she comes up with! 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additionally, we have started brainstorming names and logos for this app. We don’t plan to call the final version ‘Gamified Task Manager’ so hopefully we can come up with a memorable name and a matching logo design. During the remaining time in the meeting we brainstormed as a group for about 10 minutes, but we plan to brainstorm on our own time within a shared document. Then during our next meeting, we will discuss our ideas together. That’s all for this week!

                  Today, Kip and I met to work on the Navbar. We used existing code that came with an online template. However, there were some bugs relating to the Task Screen that we had to fix before we could get going with the Navbar. After about half an hour of trial and error, we were able to get the nav bar to appear in its default form. From here, we changed the Navbar to have appropriate items for our app, which includes a todo list screen, a quest screen, a character appearance screen, and a settings screen. We mentioned following the convention of having only 3 screens, since this is standard for many apps (such as Snapchat and Tinder), so it would be more familiar and user-friendly if our app also followed this app. Our Navbar currently has 4 items, but we can move the settings into an upper right corner or some other location such that our Navbar has 3 items. This is someth	ing that we will bring up during tomorrow’s team meeting to get more insight. Kip and I also changed some colors such that when the user is on a screen, the icon for that screen will appear purple (this is a temporary color which we can change later when we have more solidly decided on aesthetics). At this point, we had a functioning version of a Navbar when we ran our code in Expo!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Something that is still confusing to me is the LinkingConfiguration.js file. It seems like this file is what allows the Navbar icons to actually link to other screens, but this is just my best guess. I will spend some time doing some online research to see if I can find anything more concrete. As is, our Navbar works pretty well! If the team has additional feedback about the appearance or setup of the navbar regarding colors, icon placement, icon appearance, or number of items, this should be a pretty easy fix for Kip and I to implement. I am overall very happy with the current state of the Navbar!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today I also spent some time becoming more familiar with our Github setup. Previously, I have only worked in the master branch when pushing and pulling, but with the help of Kip’s documentation, I was able to successfully set up VS Code to work in the developer branch! I spent some time making sure that I had the correct libraries downloaded and that I could view a test version of the app on my phone via Expo. With this set up, I will be able to work on components more independently as we move forward with development!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tomorrow is our next team meeting. I’m excited to see what progress the rest of the team has made. :) Additionally, I am looking forward to asking some of the questions that came up when Kip and I were working on the Navbar regarding color schemes, Navbar format, and general setup.

                  Up to this point in the week, I have been trying to do some individual learning with React Native and some of the more advanced React concepts. However, I am finding it a bit difficult to balance my internship and my role on this project. My original plan was that I would be able to dedicate some time to the project throughout the work week after my internship hours ended. However, I am finding it a bit exhausting to be working on code for so many hours a day. :( A more balanced approach might be to work on this project on Friday evenings, Saturday afternoons, and attending meetings on Sunday. I’m switching to this approach from this point onward so I can enjoy both my internship and this project without overworking myself. So from now on, I’ll be posting progress updates on Fridays and Saturdays, then I’ll post meeting updates on Sundays.

                <p>
                  This evening I met with Allen and Kip to work on the todo list screen. We had a lot of trouble with this portion and fixing the bugs. One of these problems was because of confusion between React and React Native. Since we are new to app building, we often look to online resources for guidance and inspiration, especially in these beginning stages. However, this code is oftentimes written in React, and since we are still getting familiar with React Native, it is easy to forget to translate React code into React Native. This leads to problems with syntax, for example switching from div to View, etc. We spent quite some time fixing these types of bugs, but ultimately were able to eliminate these syntax errors! We also had some issues with text inputs, which Allen mentioned was also a point of trouble when she and Wayne were working on the Home Screen. This is an issue we will need to look into in more detail, since it is an essential part of our app design. Another issue we had was with Asynchronous Storage. To be honest, I am not completely sure what this means. I will look into this and possible ways to fix this issue before our next meeting so that I can follow along a bit better and hopefully offer some insight.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We currently have very basic functionality for this screen, where the user can input text into a text box, but it is still not in the form that we are aiming for. We would like the text input prompt to occur when the user clicks a button for ‘Add Task’ and we would like the text to appear in a to do list instead of a plain text box. This is something that we can definitely work towards, but I am very happy with the progress we have been able to make in our first meeting!

                      Today was a pretty light day for my internship, so I was able to work on some individual learning with React Native after work! I finished Programming With Mosh’s React tutorial and started his React Native tutorial. I think I have a pretty good grasp of the concepts he talks about, but I anticipate that I will be solidifying these concepts as a start coding for myself.

                      In the next few days, I hope to learn more about React Native through online tutorials and I will also start working through the second Codecademy React tutorial which covers more complex React concepts (like Parent-Child relationships and lifting states). I may not blog over the next few days as I just continue following along with tutorials since it isn’t very exciting to write or hear about. When I start working with my sub-teams, I definitely plan to blog our process thoroughly!

                      We had our second team meeting today! Today’s meeting was pretty short, but we made some important decisions about next steps and did a lot of designation of tasks during this meeting. We started our meeting by discussing where we were with learning React so that we could gauge how comfortable people were with React. We also talked about which tutorials were most effective and compiled some additional resources. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The majority of the meeting was about how we would all be able to work on the app. We are using Github for source control, but we want to make sure that we don’t run into the issue of editing the same piece of code at the same time and trying to make conflicting pushes. Ultimately, we decided to split up based on the components of the app. We split into sub teams of 2 or 3, where each subteam will meet up and call as a group as the team works on the component. The team will follow the pair-programming model of a driver (write code) and a navigator (look out for errors) in order to write code. This set-up allows us to work collaboratively on the components of the add without bumping into each other. :) We discussed how we wanted to split up the components, which was a bit difficult, since there are some parts of the app that we have not completely finished ideating. Ultimately, we decided on the general components of a welcome/sign-on screen, a checklist as the main screen of the app, a quest screen, and a navbar, which will be visible on all screens except the login screen. We decided to wait on working on the quest portion of the app, since there is a lot of more advanced functionality that comes with this portion, which might be easier to write after we have gained familiarity with React Native by working on the other, simpler portions of the app. I am on the Checklist subteam with Allen and Kip. I am also on the Navbar subteam with Kip. It’s exciting to see our ideas come together and I am looking forward to bringing these ideas to life with code!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Additionally, we have officially brought on Elissa as a visual designer. This means that she will be working on how the character, background, and icons look.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For me, the next steps are completing a few React Native tutorials compiled from today’s meeting to get more familiar with the workflow and learn how to utilize the tools in React Native. I hope to meet with the subteams later in the week (Wednesday-Saturday) after doing some additional individual learning.

                      Today I was able to finish the Tic Tac Toe coding tutorial. I am definitely glad that I did the Codecademy tutorial first before jumping into this tutorial, since this tutorial definitely used some of the more advanced React concepts such as this.props and this.state that I definitely would not have understood if I had jumped straight into this tutorial. I thought that this Tic Tac Toe tutorial was a great way to get acquainted with how to use React in practice, since I got to put into practice a lot of the concepts that I had learned by doing Codecademy problems. This tutorial walked me through how to create a functioning game of Tic Tac Toe, where you can even go back and look at old moves!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I also spent some time today starting the Programming With Moch videos. I started the React tutorial, which has important information about how to set up your developer environment, but was also a bit repetitive since I have already learned quite a bit about React through Codecademy and the Tic Tac Toe tutorial. I was not able to finish this entire video today, but I hope to finish this video at some point in the next few days to solidify my foundation in React.js. Once I finish this video, I will follow along with Mosh’s video about React Native, since the React Native video builds off of the React video. The app we are aiming to build will be a mobile app, so we will likely be mainly using React Native.

                      We are having our second meeting tomorrow, and Elissa will be joining us! Elissa is interested in joining our project, but she is also quite busy with her internship, so she is planning to sit in on our meetings for a little while before deciding if she wants to commit to the team. In preparation for the meeting, I looked over the agenda and made sure I was on track with the tasks we agreed to complete. I am looking forward to catching up with the rest of the team about what they have been working on. :)

                    Over the week, I have been working through the Codecademy Javascript and React.js tutorials. You may notice the gap between this entry and the last entry. This week I prioritized educating myself on the BLM movement and trying to contribute my support however possible. For me, it was important to put my time towards doing what I can to address the issues that plague our nation and protest the extreme injustice faced by black Americans even if it means dedicating less time to learning new languages, especially since I know I will be able to catch up later. This project is important to me and I have still been putting time towards learning this project. At this point I have completed both these tutorials, and while I think that Codecademy tutorials are a good way to get familiar with a language and explore its capabilities, I am looking forward to learning more about React through practical applications.

                    Today I was also able to download Node.js. After some online research, I found that the error was coming from the browser I was using. It seems that Chrome is not compatible with downloading Node.js, but using Firefox worked out! Now that Node.js is downloaded successfully, I should be able to follow along with more of the tutorials that we talked about during the last meeting, such as the Tic Tac Toe example from react.js and the video tutorials by Programming With Mosh. I am looking forward to getting some hands on experience coding applications with React in the next few days.

                    Today I tried to start the React tutorials that were discussed in Thursday’s meeting. However, I am having some trouble downloading Node.js. :( Additionally, since it has been a while since I have used Javascript, I think I may have to go back and review the basics of Javascript.

                    Today I started working on Codecademy’s Javascript tutorial and I hope to continue working on this over the next few days! I also know that Codecademy has a React.js tutorial, so after I finish the Javascript tutorial, I will start working on the React tutorial.

                    We had our first team meeting today. We talked through our work breakdown structure in terms the basic components we would need to cover relating to defining our problem, understanding  user needs, designing a system, prototyping, and project management activities. We have decided that we will hold meetings every Sunday once internships and research start for most of our team. This part of our meeting allowed us to understand the big picture of how this project was going to work and helped to organize the team. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We talked through the pros and cons of different languages for mobile app development. Ultimately, we have decided to build the basic prototype of our app in React since it works with both iOS and Android. If we feel constrained by React we will consider switching to Xcode or even C++ later on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We also spent some time talking about our user group. Since our target age demographic is teens and 20s, we wanted to make sure we were appealing to this audience. We noticed that nostalgia for childhood is popular with this age group, so we may try and tie in the aesthetics from the 1990s and early 2000s (ex: Avatar, Animal Crossing, Club Penguin). For this age group representation and justice is very important, so we will make sure that our avatar customization features include representation options that are inclusive of groups that may not be well-represented in traditional media (POC and LGBTQ+). We also think that our storyline for our quests should include elements that are important to this age group, such as justice, free will, technology, etc.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Next, we discussed user interaction and what we felt was lacking from existing apps. We found that existing gamified task managers can be stressful in terms of “punishing” the user when they fail to complete tasks. Instead of punishment, we are thinking about encouraging “streaks” (keep completing tasks for consecutive days) by offering rewards.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lastly, we went through our team contract just to make sure we are all on the same page and to have a written agreement in the event that we run into issues or disagreements later. We decided that before the next meeting, we should all get familiar with React. We found a couple of online tutorials and agreed to complete or attempt them before our next meeting on June 7. At this point in the process its fun to see ideas come together and start learning new skills!

                      Today was the start of the project! We assembled our team, consisting of Allen, Kip, Wayne, and I. Allen is taking the lead on this project so far in terms of creating repositories, meeting agendas, and calendars. We have set up a meeting for this Thursday so that we can talk through some ideas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Allen, Kip, and I had a brainstorming session about what our app might look like through Discord chat. We think we might use a questline as the main feature of our app, where users collect items when they finish tasks and these items will be used in order to unlock new quests. When quests are finished the user can collect new avatar customizations. We were also considering character designs. We may integrate bitmoji in order to maintain the wide customization aspect. We were also considering drawing out our own character designs although this may be time consuming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Between now and Thursday, we plan to individually research what goes into app development so that we can come to a consensus about things to learn and how to split up tasks. I’m excited about where this project has the potential to go! :)
