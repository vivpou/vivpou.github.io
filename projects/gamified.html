                      Today was a pretty light day for my internship, so I was able to work on some individual learning with React Native after work! I finished Programming With Mosh’s React tutorial and started his React Native tutorial. I think I have a pretty good grasp of the concepts he talks about, but I anticipate that I will be solidifying these concepts as a start coding for myself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In the next few days, I hope to learn more about React Native through online tutorials and I will also start working through the second Codecademy React tutorial which covers more complex React concepts (like Parent-Child relationships and lifting states). I may not blog over the next few days as I just continue following along with tutorials since it isn’t very exciting to write or hear about. When I start working with my sub-teams, I definitely plan to blog our process thoroughly!

                      We had our second team meeting today! Today’s meeting was pretty short, but we made some important decisions about next steps and did a lot of designation of tasks during this meeting. We started our meeting by discussing where we were with learning React so that we could gauge how comfortable people were with React. We also talked about which tutorials were most effective and compiled some additional resources. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The majority of the meeting was about how we would all be able to work on the app. We are using Github for source control, but we want to make sure that we don’t run into the issue of editing the same piece of code at the same time and trying to make conflicting pushes. Ultimately, we decided to split up based on the components of the app. We split into sub teams of 2 or 3, where each subteam will meet up and call as a group as the team works on the component. The team will follow the pair-programming model of a driver (write code) and a navigator (look out for errors) in order to write code. This set-up allows us to work collaboratively on the components of the add without bumping into each other. :) We discussed how we wanted to split up the components, which was a bit difficult, since there are some parts of the app that we have not completely finished ideating. Ultimately, we decided on the general components of a welcome/sign-on screen, a checklist as the main screen of the app, a quest screen, and a navbar, which will be visible on all screens except the login screen. We decided to wait on working on the quest portion of the app, since there is a lot of more advanced functionality that comes with this portion, which might be easier to write after we have gained familiarity with React Native by working on the other, simpler portions of the app. I am on the Checklist subteam with Allen and Kip. I am also on the Navbar subteam with Kip. It’s exciting to see our ideas come together and I am looking forward to bringing these ideas to life with code!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Additionally, we have officially brought on Elissa as a visual designer. This means that she will be working on how the character, background, and icons look.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For me, the next steps are completing a few React Native tutorials compiled from today’s meeting to get more familiar with the workflow and learn how to utilize the tools in React Native. I hope to meet with the subteams later in the week (Wednesday-Saturday) after doing some additional individual learning.

                      Today I was able to finish the Tic Tac Toe coding tutorial. I am definitely glad that I did the Codecademy tutorial first before jumping into this tutorial, since this tutorial definitely used some of the more advanced React concepts such as this.props and this.state that I definitely would not have understood if I had jumped straight into this tutorial. I thought that this Tic Tac Toe tutorial was a great way to get acquainted with how to use React in practice, since I got to put into practice a lot of the concepts that I had learned by doing Codecademy problems. This tutorial walked me through how to create a functioning game of Tic Tac Toe, where you can even go back and look at old moves!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I also spent some time today starting the Programming With Moch videos. I started the React tutorial, which has important information about how to set up your developer environment, but was also a bit repetitive since I have already learned quite a bit about React through Codecademy and the Tic Tac Toe tutorial. I was not able to finish this entire video today, but I hope to finish this video at some point in the next few days to solidify my foundation in React.js. Once I finish this video, I will follow along with Mosh’s video about React Native, since the React Native video builds off of the React video. The app we are aiming to build will be a mobile app, so we will likely be mainly using React Native.

                      We are having our second meeting tomorrow, and Elissa will be joining us! Elissa is interested in joining our project, but she is also quite busy with her internship, so she is planning to sit in on our meetings for a little while before deciding if she wants to commit to the team. In preparation for the meeting, I looked over the agenda and made sure I was on track with the tasks we agreed to complete. I am looking forward to catching up with the rest of the team about what they have been working on. :)

                    Over the week, I have been working through the Codecademy Javascript and React.js tutorials. You may notice the gap between this entry and the last entry. This week I prioritized educating myself on the BLM movement and trying to contribute my support however possible. For me, it was important to put my time towards doing what I can to address the issues that plague our nation and protest the extreme injustice faced by black Americans even if it means dedicating less time to learning new languages, especially since I know I will be able to catch up later. This project is important to me and I have still been putting time towards learning this project. At this point I have completed both these tutorials, and while I think that Codecademy tutorials are a good way to get familiar with a language and explore its capabilities, I am looking forward to learning more about React through practical applications.

                    Today I was also able to download Node.js. After some online research, I found that the error was coming from the browser I was using. It seems that Chrome is not compatible with downloading Node.js, but using Firefox worked out! Now that Node.js is downloaded successfully, I should be able to follow along with more of the tutorials that we talked about during the last meeting, such as the Tic Tac Toe example from react.js and the video tutorials by Programming With Mosh. I am looking forward to getting some hands on experience coding applications with React in the next few days.

                    Today I tried to start the React tutorials that were discussed in Thursday’s meeting. However, I am having some trouble downloading Node.js. :( Additionally, since it has been a while since I have used Javascript, I think I may have to go back and review the basics of Javascript.

                    Today I started working on Codecademy’s Javascript tutorial and I hope to continue working on this over the next few days! I also know that Codecademy has a React.js tutorial, so after I finish the Javascript tutorial, I will start working on the React tutorial.

                    We had our first team meeting today. We talked through our work breakdown structure in terms the basic components we would need to cover relating to defining our problem, understanding  user needs, designing a system, prototyping, and project management activities. We have decided that we will hold meetings every Sunday once internships and research start for most of our team. This part of our meeting allowed us to understand the big picture of how this project was going to work and helped to organize the team. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We talked through the pros and cons of different languages for mobile app development. Ultimately, we have decided to build the basic prototype of our app in React since it works with both iOS and Android. If we feel constrained by React we will consider switching to Xcode or even C++ later on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We also spent some time talking about our user group. Since our target age demographic is teens and 20s, we wanted to make sure we were appealing to this audience. We noticed that nostalgia for childhood is popular with this age group, so we may try and tie in the aesthetics from the 1990s and early 2000s (ex: Avatar, Animal Crossing, Club Penguin). For this age group representation and justice is very important, so we will make sure that our avatar customization features include representation options that are inclusive of groups that may not be well-represented in traditional media (POC and LGBTQ+). We also think that our storyline for our quests should include elements that are important to this age group, such as justice, free will, technology, etc.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Next, we discussed user interaction and what we felt was lacking from existing apps. We found that existing gamified task managers can be stressful in terms of “punishing” the user when they fail to complete tasks. Instead of punishment, we are thinking about encouraging “streaks” (keep completing tasks for consecutive days) by offering rewards.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lastly, we went through our team contract just to make sure we are all on the same page and to have a written agreement in the event that we run into issues or disagreements later. We decided that before the next meeting, we should all get familiar with React. We found a couple of online tutorials and agreed to complete or attempt them before our next meeting on June 7. At this point in the process its fun to see ideas come together and start learning new skills!

                      Today was the start of the project! We assembled our team, consisting of Allen, Kip, Wayne, and I. Allen is taking the lead on this project so far in terms of creating repositories, meeting agendas, and calendars. We have set up a meeting for this Thursday so that we can talk through some ideas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Allen, Kip, and I had a brainstorming session about what our app might look like through Discord chat. We think we might use a questline as the main feature of our app, where users collect items when they finish tasks and these items will be used in order to unlock new quests. When quests are finished the user can collect new avatar customizations. We were also considering character designs. We may integrate bitmoji in order to maintain the wide customization aspect. We were also considering drawing out our own character designs although this may be time consuming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Between now and Thursday, we plan to individually research what goes into app development so that we can come to a consensus about things to learn and how to split up tasks. I’m excited about where this project has the potential to go! :)
