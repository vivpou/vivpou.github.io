                        I forgot to blog these while they were happening, but here is a belated summary of some of the work done in August! We found some trees in the ArcGIS map which had incorrect coordinates, which led to them being placed in LA instead of in Claremont. Out of 800+ trees, there were only 4 misplaced trees, so we fixed the coordinates manually. The trees are all in the right place now!

                        Jeannine emailed me and informed me of how to transfer my ArcGIS files to another user’s account using the ArcGIS online assistant tool (ago-assistant.esri.com). I tested this process by trying to transfer projects from my CGU ArcGIS account to my library ArcGIS account. It took some trial and error to get the hang of, but was a relatively straightforward process. However, since this required that both were logged into their ArcGIS accounts on the same machine, I needed to meet Prof. Medero in person in order to successfully transfer the maps. I was able to successfully transfer the projects to Prof. Meder within the first week of getting back to Mudd, so now Prof. Medero is able to update the maps from her account and should be able to transfer the maps to future developers if needed.

                        This morning I finished writing up the Tree Benefit analysis user guide, with help from Christina in helping to explain the Biodiversity calculations, since she implemented this tool. We finished writing parts 6-8 (see Tuesday 7/23’s post for details on what each part contains). I finished polishing up the Tree Benefit Analysis user guide and the ArcGIS user guide and pushed them to a new github folder after lunch. With the user guides done hopefully we can help future developers be as productive as possible so that they have records of what we have accomplished this year and directions that they may be able to expand the project in the future or resolve problems that we ran into!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think that writing up this user guide, especially after all our poster presentations, has helped me step through the project again with a more big-picture perspective, whereas when we are working on the code it is easy to get caught up in the small bugs and problems that we run into.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today at 3:30 we had our final meeting with Nicole to set up the triggers from Prof. Medero's account and talk about our tree benefit analysis tool. When we got back from our meeting, we transferred the tree benefit analysis code and formatting onto the live document from our copy. Using information that Christina and I had already written, I put together a brief guide about how to use our tools more for a user perspective than a developer perspective. During our meeting we thought about deleting the static maps, but since I don't have the method used to create these maps, I didn't feel comfortable deleting them. Instead, I have put the new shade canopy map at the top and will let Sustainable Claremont decide if they would like to remove the static maps.

                    <p>
                        Today was our last official day and I feel like I got to accomplish and learn a lot from this research position, which I hope to apply in future opportunities!

                        Today I worked on more of the Tree Benefit Analysis user guide. I was able to finish parts 2-5 of the Tree Benefit User Guide this morning. I started on part 6, and I plan to finish writing and editing the guide tomorrow. (See Tuesday's post for details on the contents of each part). I ended up cutting out some of the planned sections. While these sections were important parts of our work and bug-fixing process I do not know if they would contain essential information for next year's group, and I would like to keep the guide as concise as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also got to listen to Prof. Dodds talk about grad school and particularly the PhD track, which was interesting and very eye-opening. Previously I had thought I would definitely get a Master's degree at some point but I had not considered a PhD because of the struggles I had heard about the process of getting a PhD from other people. I think that after this talk and after listening to the grad students, I would consider going down the PhD track at this point if I can find the right fit. :) We also got to talk to the grad students from UCSD and learn about their grad school experience. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tomorrow, I plan to finish writing the user guide parts 6-8 about the distribution spreadsheet analysis tool, biodiversity tool, and next steps. I will also edit this so that it is as readable as possible. We also have a CS lunch and a meeting with Nicole tomorrow to look forward to! With today as our second to last day, we are wrapping up our project and getting it ready for next year's group.

                        This morning I proofread what I wrote on Friday regarding the ArcGIS user guide. I mostly worked on improving clarity and catching some spelling/grammar mistakes. I am currently pretty happy with how the guide looks. :) I also walked through the ArcGIS step by step to create my own map and append my own data as a preliminary way to check if I had missed any steps. I will have to ask a fresh set of eyes to come in and see if my guide is clear enough or not, since it might not be the most efficient for me to go through my own guide, since I am very likely to be biased.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the rest of the day I worked on writing the guide for the Tree Benefit Analysis. This turned out to be harder than I originally anticipated. Initially, I thought writing this guide would be easier than writing the ArcGIS guide, since we made the map from scratch and it does not contain much overlap with the ArcGIS guide from last year. It turns out that writing the Tree Benefit Analysis guide, where there is a lot of overlap between our work and last year's group, actually makes things a lot harder than if I was writing a fresh guide. I don't want to repeat all the information from last year's group, but I also want the reader to be well-informed. After spending a little time struggling with writing this guide, I eventually decided to write out a rough guideline for how to structure this document. I have broken the document into 8 sections, each with some subsections. I am not totally committed to this outline since I don't really know how much information will end up fleshing out each section. I may eventually end up merging some sections or breaking into even more sections if I have too little or too much information. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For now this is what I have. The first section, which is the only section I have finished writing, introduces the project and the spreadsheet. Similar to what last year's group did, I will define some key terms, write a guide to what each spreadsheet tab's purpose is and what each menu item's purpose is. I think that these last two sections are especially important since we have accumulated so many tabs and so many tools as we have expanded this tool. The second section will talk about our work with the Individual Analysis tool. This is an important continuation that we have developed from last year's tool. I plan to point back to last year's group's document for more details on fetching from iTree and XML parsing, since we used those parts from last year’s team’s work. Third, I plan to talk about the steps we took to improve accuracy and get our results to match iTree. Fourth, I will talk about some design changes that we made in order to make the tool more user friendly. This includes fixing looping problems and getting our species dictionary directly from iTree instead of manually creating the dictionary. Fifth, I will talk about how we have taken steps to generalize the tool so that it is not just specific to Claremont (91711), primarily the set-up form and other previously hard-coded features. Sixth, I will talk about what Alina and I worked on regarding the spreadsheet distribution analysis tools. Seventh, I will talk about Christina's biodiversity tool, including what metrics it calculates, what they mean, and how it was done. Lastly, I will talk about the next steps of this project, like maybe decreasing run time, finding more indices like biodiversity to calculate, and possibly getting the static map working.

                        I'm taking tomorrow off, but on Thursday I plan to continue and hopefully even finish the Tree Benefit Analysis user guide. After yesterday’s successful poster symposium, I am hopeful that Thursday's poster session will run smoothly!

                        Today we got to go to USC for the Poster Symposium event! Christina and I got to present our work to other undergraduate students as well as professors from many other local universities. It was very eye-opening to hear about so many different fields of research and I found it inspiring to see what students my age were accomplishing. We got to answer and ask lots of interesting questions and it was very rewarding to be able to share what we have worked and what we have accomplished to so many people. After the Poster Symposium, we got to relax and spend time at the beach with the other students from the symposium. :)

                        Following the format that last year's group used for writing their Protocol for Future Developers, I wrote up a user guide, primarily targeted for next year's group or whoever will be working with the maps next, since I suspect that Sustainable Claremont is quite busy keeping up with their other tasks. The user guide is about 8 pages total and details all parts of creating the ArcGIS map. I may need to condense the guide so that it is not so wordy and overwhelming. If Sustainable Claremont does want to update the map themselves, I may need to write a separate guide with a more step-by-step of how to create and update maps and less of the technical information about the code and the design choices we have made.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here is a general idea of what I decided to include in my guide for future developers. The introduction explains how we expanded on last year's group's work as well as why we have chosen to use ArcGIS Online. It also acknowledges the need for an ArcGIS account and how our accounts this year were set up through Brian Hilton from CGU as part of the Advanced GIS Lab. The first portion talks about the data collection and reformatting that we needed to do in order to get the tree data from Sustainable Claremont's spreadsheet to the ArcGIS readable format using redundant rows. I think that the version that I have written goes over what the code does, but since Christina worked primarily on this part, I may ask her if she wants to take a look at this part and edit/add anything, just to ensure that I have not missed any crucial information. The second portion talks about how to make a new map. I think that this part is important for when Sustainable Claremont starts new planting projects and new shade canopy maps need to be made. This portion details the process of making the tree markers and the shade canopies and explains the reasoning behind the choices we have made regarding layers and buffers. Hopefully this will help future developers pick up from where we have left off instead of having to rediscover what we have learned. ArcGIS is not very intuitive, so I think that it is important to outline exactly what we have done and how we have used ArcGIS in order to avoid some of the confusion that we experienced. The third portion talks about how to append data to existing maps. This would be used in the case that a certain planting project is being continued and new trees have been added. There is a definitive way to add new data to layers, which I have detailed in the user guide, but there is still no definitive way to add new data to buffers. In this section I have also detailed the ways that I have tried to add new data to buffers and why they have not worked. I suggest remaking the buffers even though this uses credits, but hopefully we will come across a better solution in the next week. The fourth portion talks briefly about how we go from an ArcGIS map to an embeddable map either by creating a Web App or by incorporating it into a Story Map. I have found that the tutorials regarding Esri Story Maps are pretty easy to follow, so this portion includes a little less detail than the previous three sections. The last portion talks about what we have been able to accomplish this year regarding making our dynamically interactive shade canopy map as well as a link for where to view this map. It also details what problems still exist with this version of the map, primarily that it does not update automatically from the Google sheet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next Monday is our poster presentation at USC, which is exciting since it is my first time being on the presenting side of a formal poster symposium session! Next week I will also revise my ArcGIS user guide to make it as readable as possible. I have yet to receive an email back from Warren about transferring ownership or allowing editing access to ArcGIS projects, but once I receive a response, I will work on transferring ownership/giving editing access of my projects to Prof. Medero so that future developers can continue working on these projects and keep them up to date.

Some of the facts I calculated are: Over 25 years, the ReLeaf 1.0 project alone will have: removed an amount of CO2 from the air equivalent to 23,854 gallons of gas, saved an amount of electricity equivalent to leaving 100 lightbulbs on for 2 years continuously, saved an amount of electricity equivalent to the amount of electricity 10 houses use in a year. I sent these fun facts over to Nicole in case she wants to use them or in case she would like more similar facts. :)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also looked into how to transfer editing permissions from my account to someone else's account so that Prof. Medero or next year’s group can edit and update the maps from their own ArcGIS accounts. I could not find any conclusive way to do this so I emailed Warren and asked for his help on how to transfer ownership or give editing access to others.

                        Christina and I also worked on condensing the poster information into bullets for most of the afternoon. Tomorrow, I plan to practice presenting the poster and finding other fun facts.

                        Today I figured out a way to successfully append data in ArcGIS, although there are still some problems. Using the function written yesterday afternoon and by manually matching data fields in ArcGIS once the CSV file is uploaded, it is relatively straightforward to append new data without disrupting the existing fields. I can definitely write a user guide for this process and give access to my ArcGIS account so that Green Crew can add new data. However, there are still some problems regarding updating the data. When the data is updated, the tree markers displaying locations are updated with the data but the buffers displaying the shade canopies do not update. It would be impractical to recreate all the buffers each time that new data is added since it uses quite a few credits to make all new buffers. :( I have not yet found a way to only make buffers for some data points and not all data points.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Christina also pointed out an error regarding viewing the shade canopy maps on the green crew website this morning. Initially I thought that this was because we had too many trees/too many data points, so I tried splitting up the map. However, it quickly became apparent that it had to do with the permissions of the applications. Permissions have been fixed, so now the shade canopy maps are live and viewable by everyone on the Green Crew website. I’m glad Christina caught this error early on!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also spent some time using our existing tree benefit analysis tool to calculate some fun facts that Green Crew can use in their message reminders. So far, I have been working with the Releaf data to calculate some benefits over 25 years using some of our newly calculated units like gallons of gas and light bulbs. I also started compiling individual benefits data combined with the weighted percentages to come up with an "average tree" benefits. I will finish coming up with 'average tree' benefits tomorrow and continue thinking of facts we can write up. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also have a meeting with Nicole today at 4pm to fix some triggers on the contact tool, so that tonight's messages can be sent out smoothly. Hopefully this will go smoothly and residents get their messages! Tomorrow I plan to continue working on the fun facts and perhaps think of other ways to package the information and practice what we are going to say for Monday's poster session.

                        This morning Christina and I started working on the poster for Monday's event, and we were able to pretty much finish it by mid-afternoon! Our poster details the overall motivation behind the project as a whole, the methods we used, details about the three main parts of our project (TakeRoot, Analysis tool, Shade Canopy), and a conclusion about what we feel we have accomplished throughout the project. Visuals include a flow-chart of how the Analysis tool works, biodiversity metrics, the spreadsheet set up of the contact tool, and a screenshot from our shade canopy map. The poster is currently a little wordy, but after looking at some of the example posters that Prof. Dodds sent out, it seems like the amount of text that we have on our poster is reasonable compared to the examples and considering the size of the poster. We may edit the poster later this week, but for now I am happy with where the poster is.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also did a little bit of brainstorming about how we might disseminate the tree benefits to the residents of Claremont. We currently have a lot of great information and calculations in our spreadsheet and using our analysis tool, but this information is not really available to the general public. Prof. Medero suggested writing something that can automatically create flyers about some of our more 'fun' metrics like gallons of gas or lightbulbs. Additionally, I changed the CO2 sequestered from pounds to gallons of gas in the shade canopy map live on the website, so hopefully this is one way of sharing our information. Further steps could be using the analysis tool to calculate some facts that we could add to Green Crew's list of fun facts. For example, we could report how many CO2 equivalent gallons of gas ReLeaf 1.0 will remove from the air after 50 years, or how many days worth of lightbulbs one tree saves over 20 years. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thus far I still am not able to find a feasible way to get ArcGIS to live update from the Google Spreadsheet, so I think I may need to take the route of writing a user guide of how to manually update the map using the tools we have built so far. Writing this user guide is something I plan to tackle either this week or between poster sessions next week. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I worked on adding to Christina's code that formats the data to be ArcGIS readable to create a tool which makes it easier to update the map. Previously, there was a function that would take any newly selected trees from the 'All spreadsheet and add the processed data of these new trees to the existing processed data. This was incredibly useful for creating the maps initially, but may be difficult when users just want to append new tree data. By working with Christina's existing code, I was able to write a function that puts the ArcGIS outputs of only selected trees into a new spreadsheet tab. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tomorrow I will do some testing and make sure that everything in the new ArcGIS function works as expected. If this works then I can start working on the user guide tomorrow, otherwise I will spend time troubleshooting. Additionally, I may work with the benefit analysis tool to come up with the aforementioned fun facts so that these calculations/facts can reach Claremont residents.

                        This morning I finished implementing the shade canopy map that I have been working on for the last week or two. I ran into some trouble embedding the map into the website because of the large number of trees in our total map. I was able to work around this by making a new map, embedding that empty map, then adding the trees little by little. This method is not ideal, but  I think it will work for our purposes since the map on the website updates live from any changes made to the map, so it seems unlikely that we will need to re-embed the map. I spent some time cleaning up some of the pop-ups, zooming, and overall visual design. I am happy with how it looks, and I think the version currently live on the website will be the final version. :) 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One problem that I have not been able to resolve is the issue of live updating data from the google sheet into ArcGIS. After some research and having talked to Brian last week, it does not seem like we really have a feasible solution. If I upload from the web instead of from a downloaded CSV, the data can update live, but we lose the ability to use a time slider. I poked around on ArcGIS and it looks like we can append CSV files to the current data to update the map. This would be relatively easy to do given if the user has an ArcGIS account. I am willing to give my ArcGIS login information to Green Crew or to next year's group and to write a user guide for how to update the data if no other solution to this problem is found. I may try emailing Jeannine and/or Warren to see if they have additional suggestions, but from what I have found, it may be necessary to manually update the maps. I think that especially with a user guide this process should be relatively easy even for someone without ArcGIS experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I spent some time this afternoon planning for a poster that we can use for next week's events on Monday at USC and on Thursday here at Mudd. I think that for the most part we can use a condensed version of the information that we had in our CS chat. I don't think making this poster will be too challenging since we have a lot of the packaged information already in our slides. My current plant has the most essential parts of our project, so just the basics of Contact, Analysis Tool, and the Shade Canopy Map. We may have to cut out some things like DAC scraping, spreadsheet analysis (although I hope to include a graph displaying biodiversity), and ArcGIS Insights.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today I also implemented the conversions from some of our less easily visualized units into units that might be more familiar to the general public. Specifically, I added conversions from pounds of CO2 to gallons of gas and from kWh to days if one lightbulb was left on continuously. I think that if Sustainable Claremont wants to communicate the tree benefits to the general public, these units may be more effective in communicating the positive benefits of trees, since people can more easily imagine a gallon of gas or a lightbulb as opposed to a pound of CO2 or kilowatt-hours. The way I have currently implemented these unit conversions is by adding an extra row or column in our result spreadsheet tabs. Christina also implemented the Biodiversity calculations into the spreadsheet, so that when users analyze the tree species, they also get a pop-up with information about the biodiversity of the trees they are analyzing. With these pieces implemented, I think that we are pretty much done with the coding part of the analysis tool. From here, we may just need to clean up the code and spreadsheets in preparation for implementing the tool. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tomorrow, I will start working on our poster based on the plan today and get feedback about the plan from the rest of the team. I also may start cleaning up the code.

                        Throughout the morning and the early afternoon I got as far as I could regarding making the shade canopy maps. I think I finally decided on a design to be used for the maps. I decided to still include the tree markers so that users can see the overall spread of all the trees over the whole area. If we remove these markers and only have the buffers, the scaling of the buffers makes it nearly impossible to see all of the trees together. These small markers representing each tree’s location and species do not change in size as you zoom in and out. But then as you zoom in closer you can see the shade canopies of each tree, which are to-scale with the map and which I have decided to leave as a green color for all trees. This approach allows the user to see the placement of all the trees using tree markers even if they zoom further out, while the buffers allow the user to see an accurately sized tree canopy that changes to-scale with the rest of the map as the user zooms in or out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The only problem I ran into today was that I ran out of credits when making the last map of all the trees. I have emailed Brian asking for more credits so that I can finish the last of making the map, and hopefully I will be able to receive these credits soon so that I can finish up the maps for good. Another issue that I need to look into is getting the data in ArcGIS to automatically update with the google spreadsheet. I have asked Brian about this, but it does not seem like this is an easily fixable solution. I will look further into ways to work around this issue next week, as the preliminary searching that I did today did not yield anything useful. I am happy with the progress being made with the maps, and hopefully we will be able to implement this map very soon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today we also got to see Alina present during the Upward Bound presentations! Alina did a great job and I am sad to see her go, but I hope she had fun during her internship and learned a lot about computer science!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also spent some time this afternoon cleaning up the data analysis tools that Alina and I worked on together. Some of the functions did not have comments, so I added a few comments and fixed some syntax. I also implemented some additions that we did not have time to work on together. Alina and I decided that some of the data would be better viewed as a bar graph instead of a pie chart, so I implemented these changes. I also got the outputs to display in descending order for the tree species analysis tool for ease of viewing since before the numbers were kind of jumbled and hard to read. Sorting by descending order actually ended up being more difficult than I anticipated, since I had to convert the dictionary to an array, apply a sort function to the array, then convert the array back into a dictionary. Next week I will look into what might be useful information regarding a Biodiversity index. I think that depending on the complexity of the Biodiversity index formula, it may only take a couple lines of code to calculate the biodiversity from our data and print this value in the spreadsheet for Green Crew to use!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think that by next week, I will definitely be done developing the maps, so we can embed those into the website ASAP. We also need to work on a poster for the poster event that Prof. Dodds mentioned we would be going to at USC's Huntington Beach campus.

                        This morning I continued preparing my slides and a few back up slides for our presentation as well as running through my slides a few times. I think that the presentation went fairly well and I got to talk about my backup slides and show the updated version of the map that I finished this morning.

                        At 1:30 we met with Brian from the ArcGIS lab to talk about the maps we have been working on. It seems like the method that Christina and I have been working on is the most feasible method for making the maps, so we will proceed with this method.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We spent the afternoon running the ArcGIS analysis on the rest of the trees and starting the process of making the new maps for each project. One concern that I brought up during our meeting with Brian is that the data does not update as the google spreadsheet updates. This is something I will look into tomorrow to see if I can fix. If not, we may have to write a user guide for how to manually update the map. Tomorrow I plan to finish making the maps for the rest of the projects using our newly processed data, then look into how we might embed the map into the Green Crew website.

                        This morning, we discovered that the DNS error that we were running into yesterday has now been fixed. :) We think that we made too many iTree requests, and they temporarily blocked us. In order to combat this problem, Prof. Medero suggested that we implement throttling so that we can request information in a more reasonable way so as to avoid getting blocked again.

                    <p>
                        For the rest of the morning and the early afternoon, I looked into getting the canopies to be to-scale with the rest of the map. This was accomplished using buffers since buffers require units and thus change proportionally with the map as you zoom in and out, whereas layers do not. Christina worked with getting the canopy sizes to work accurately with ArcGIS. With the correct information and after a little bit of messing around and familiarizing myself with buffers, we now are able to create a shade canopy map where the shade canopies are proportional to the rest of the map. We also are able to maintain distinction between species of trees, since buffers can be categorized just like layers can. With the data that we have processed so far, we have been able to create an essentially finalized version of the ReLeaf 1.0 trees' shade canopy map. Next, we will need to process the rest of the data so that we can make the total shade canopy map. Hopefully, this process runs smoothly, since I think I have the method down pretty solidly, it's just a matter of repeating these final steps.

                        The rest of the afternoon was spent practicing our presentation. After hearing and presenting the slides, I will convert some slides to back-up slides (ie the iTree technical slide). I also will make some backup slides for the ArcGIS map, since if people have questions more specifically about how we made our map I want to be prepared to answer them. While Reymon has some great information about ArcGIS as a system and the reason that we are using ArcGIS,  if people have questions about the map itself I want to have the resources to answer them. I think I still need to condense my slides a bit more or even break them up into multiple slides, and I may write up some presentation notes with the more technical information so that I still have the information written out available to me, but it will not be crowding the slides.

                        Tomorrow, I will continue working on the ArcGIS map to get closer to a finalized version and I will prepare for our CS chat tomorrow morning. We also have a meeting with Brian Hilton from CGU's ArcGIS lab, so if I am running into difficulties with making the map, I will ask him tomorrow.

                        This morning when we tried to run the code for the iTree Automation, we received an error saying "Execution failed: DNS error”. When we ran the code yesterday, everything was working fine, and I don't think we have changed anything regarding the url or the xml files since yesterday. We spent some time trying to fix this error by restoring old versions and rechecking the url from the source code, but we keep getting the same error. Christina and I suspect that we may have made too many requests to iTree and they have blocked our requests. :( We are hoping for some guidance from Prof. Medero about how to deal with this problem so that we can continue working on our spreadsheet analysis tool and our maps. We might need to reach out to iTree so that we don't run into this problem in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also spent some time today working on expanding the Tree Benefit Analysis Tool. I think something quick that I can implement is conversion from our current units into more easy-to-understand units. For example I could convert pounds of CO2 into car exhaust, and kWh into lightbulb use. This would help Green Crew present their information to the more general public more easily and hopefully more effectively when the units are easier to visualize.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I spent most of the afternoon working on ArcGIS. Christina was able to fix the problem of some tree names being common names or capitalized through some coding. Now, Once we are able to use iTree again, we will be able to run the ArcGIS code in the spreadsheet to create a correctly formatted sheet and create our total shade canopy map! I am not sure about the status of the buffer method of creating the map. I also started making the story map. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I now have a test version of what the story map might look like. I am thinking that we would have different tabs for each project, where the first tab is all 883 trees planted and each following tab is one planting project with some corresponding information. Currently it seems like this is very doable, since I was able to map three different test versions of shade canopy maps, all with working time sliders. Something I still need to work on is getting the shade canopies to be to scale with the rest of the map, since they are currently too large. I need to do some online research about whether this is feasible or not.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tomorrow, hopefully we will be able to fix our DNS problem with iTree. I will also look into getting the canopies to be proportional, although this is not an immediate concern. If we are able to fix the iTree DNS problem, Christina and I will be able to make a correctly formatted spreadsheet for all the trees and make the shade canopy map as Sustainable Claremont has requested. Reymon’s slides for the ArcGIS portion of the presentation still do not seem to be complete, but I am hopeful that they will be done by tomorrow afternoon, in time for us to practice our presentation. Otherwise, I think the rest of the presentation looks good!

                        I started off today by working through some small bugs from the preliminary shade canopy map that I was able to get working on Friday. The pop-up on each tree had some unessential information like longitude, latitude, and our placeholder date, but I have configured the pop up so that it only holds the essential information like its canopy size and information about its benefits which are calculated from our tree benefit analysis tool using iTree. I also changed some settings on the time slider so that it has the correct time intervals where the tree canopies are and got rid of the gaps. This is just the preliminary version since Reymon is still working on getting the buffers to work. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the method of using buffers instead of layers ends up working, then we can take steps to get the map working for all trees instead of just the 100 tree test set that I have been working on. Some problems that need to be addressed once we decide on a method of building the map: proportional tree canopies, time dependent benefit displays, expansion to all trees. We need to get the canopies to be to scale, since currently the canopies are preset by ArcGIS and are nowhere near being to scale. Another thing to look into is getting the benefits to be relative to what year the time slider is on. Currently, no matter where the time slider is, we are showing benefits for 40 years, but I think it might be interesting to have the 5 year benefits pop up when the time slider is at the 5 year mark, 10 year benefits at the 10 year mark, etc. Lastly, there are some issues with the current format of the spreadsheet with capital letters and slight differences in how the species are typed, which makes it hard to make a map across different projects. We currently only have a map on the ReLeaf 1.0 trees, so we need to look into having our code deal with these formatting differences to make an accurate map across projects.

                    <p>
                        I also spent some time polishing up the slides for the CS chat. It seems like the slides are essentially done (with the exception of the slides relating to the ArcGIS map). Inspired by the more technical nature of the CS Chats we saw last week, I think that more technical information is more appropriate for our audience. There has also been more detail added regarding the motivation and next steps for our project.

                    <p>
                        I spent most of the afternoon working with Alina on writing the tree species analysis tool. We have made much more progress today than I had originally anticipated! We have an accurately running and relatively efficient version of the code working and giving up results, which is much farther along than I had originally anticipated being today. We worked with for-each loops to get through the tree species and handled the large amount of tree species by storing the species and their counts in dictionaries. We also made the choice not to display tree species that had a count of 0 in order to improve readability. I have a few ideas for tomorrow or Wednesday of how to make the tool more user friendly and more effective. We have been displaying our results in a pie chart, since the other variables we have been analyzing have had only a few categories and reported in percentages, so a pie chart made the most sense. However, since there are so many tree species, I think we may want to display our results in a bar graph for this particular instance for ease of viewing. After looking at the results, I think it also may be helpful to display our table from highest percentage to lowest percentage, since they are currently a little jumbled, and this makes it hard to read and interpret the numbers. Sorting the table would again improve the ease of viewing, even though it is not strictly necessary. Lastly, I think it could be interesting to calculate biodiversity if we can find a formula online or even a biodiversity calculator online.

                    <p>
                        Tomorrow, depending on the progress regarding the buffer method of making the shade map, I may start working on some of the aforementioned problems regarding the shade canopy map. If there is no notable progress, then I may spend some more time thinking about how to expand the tree benefit analysis tool, and set up a meeting with Prof. Medero to talk about the ideas I have brainstormed. On Wednesday, by which time all the slides will hopefully be done, we can practice presenting our CS chat as a group. Otherwise, we may just need to practice the parts that are done.

                        This morning was a little frustrating as I spent a lot of time trying to find how to publish a CSV data file as a feature layer, without much progress. However, after some emailing with Brian Hilton from the ArcGIS lab at CGU, we finally figured out that the problem was coming from the fact that I was using an account without the right permissions. So, after getting the right account set up, I was able to finally Enable Time Settings on ArcGIS Online for the CSV data file (now publishable as a Feature Layer). After a couple minutes of exploring the new account I was able to get the time slider working for the 10 tree mini test data set.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the afternoon, Christina and I worked together to get the time slider to work for the larger data set of about 100 trees from the ReLeaf 1.0 project. Christina has been working on writing code to format the data from the original spreadsheet and from our benefit analysis outputs so that when I upload the data into ArcGIS, each tree has information about its long term (40 year) benefits. We spent a little time working with the formatting so that ArcGIS could read our spreadsheet. One main problem that we fixed is that when there was a crossed out row, originally the output spreadsheet would have 'undefined' values, which caused problems in ArcGIS, but now any crossed out rows are set to the default (Crapemyrtle) tree. This is a temporary fix, so we may come back and find some other way to deal with crossed out rows later on. With the formatting fixed and the mini test data working, we now have a preliminary version of the Shade Canopy Map! Some problems we still need to deal with are inconsistencies in how certain trees are entered, since some tree species are uppercase which causes problems with our code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In between working with ArcGIS code, I spent some time brainstorming ways I could expand the Tree Benefit Analysis Tool. Prof. Medero mentioned that I might be able to write some code to get the data to be easier to understand and more accessible to a wider audience. So some initial ideas I have are: convert our numbers into more easily imaginable units (Pounds of CO2 -> car exhaust, kwh -> lightbulbs, etc.), comparing relative benefits of certain variables (i.e. how do benefits change between species, direction, etc.), and packaging the results from our spreadsheet into something that could be implemented into a website. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also talked to Alina a little bit about her slides, and it seems like she is making good progress so we can work on the species analysis tool soon!

                    <p>
                        Next week there are a few things to work on. One is to get the ArcGIS map to work for all 883 trees, since now we have it working but only for 134 trees. I might let Reymon work on this a little more heavily since he will be talking about this portion of the project on Thursday. We also need to practice for our CS chat on Thursday by going through the presentation a few times and finishing the map portion of the slides. I will also work with Alina on the tree species analysis tool, which hopefully we can finish next week.

                        I spent the vast majority of today working with the ArcGIS map tools to try and get the time slider to appear. I reached out to Brian Hilton a few times and I think I am much closer to getting the time slider working. Throughout today's exploration I found that it is necessary to add the data table as an item and then as a layer instead of adding it directly to the map as a layer. This is necessary in order for ArcGIS to read in the dates and to enable the time settings necessary for a slider. The only problem is that with this method of time slider, we will be using the redundant rows. This might work, since Christina is working on a spreadsheet format where we have individual spreadsheets for each time interval.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tomorrow I will continue trying to find the optimal way to create a time slider for our tree data. I also may start introducing dictionaries and for-each loops to Alina if she feels comfortable with her slides by tomorrow.

                        In the morning, Alina and I first worked on debugging the function we had written yesterday that analyzed the distribution of tree directions. Some problems that we fixed were that the code was originally still counting the crossed out trees, and trees with 'N/A' directions were still being included as part of the total number of trees analyzed, so our percentages were consistently adding up to less than 100%. With a few new if statements and variables we were able to fix these problems so that the code makes the correct calculations! We were also able to successfully implement pie charts that automatically pop up for the data when we run the data analysis. Alina then worked mostly independently on writing the analysis tools for preferred contact method and tree distance since this code was similar to the function that we already wrote for direction distribution. Although there were some occasional questions, errors, and clarifications needed, Alina was able to write these functions largely on her own!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While Alina worked on these two new analysis functions, I finished up my portion of the slides and determined where Alina's slides about spreadsheet analysis might go. I also experimented with ArcGIS. One problem we currently have with ArcGIS is that according to Brian (from CGU), in order to get the time slider to show up, we need to have redundant rows for each tree, which would mean our 800 line spreadsheet would multiply by however many time intervals we want to analyze. I tried working with a small sample of about 40 trees to see what was possible. I tried a few different formats of spreadsheets to see what options we had for displaying the tree crown growth. So far I have inconclusive results, so I will continue working on this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the afternoon we went up to the Green crew office to implement the DAC tool that Christina worked on as well as the Contact messaging tool. Although I did not directly work with much of the code, it was fun to be able to show Nicole the spreadsheet analysis tool that Alina and I worked on as well as the logo we have for our app. There were some minor errors, but we were largely able to transfer the tools over successfully! :)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tomorrow I plan to work on any errors that might pop up for the Contact messaging tool to the best of my ability. I also plan to continue exploring ArcGIS to see what might be the best way to format our spreadsheet.

                        This morning I spent some time looking at potential ArcGIS maps that will work for our purposes. I think that a potential format that might work as an embedded interactive map is having one embedded item on the website with multiple interactive maps (almost like slides) that the user could click through. I think that this would work if we had one 'slide' for each planting project (ex: one for Releaf 1.0, one for Solis City, etc.). Another potential form that could work is just having one large interactive map with all the projects, but this may be too overwhelming and messy since we have over 800 trees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I spent the rest of the morning working with Alina on finishing up our first spreadsheet tool. We now have code that can analyze the directions of the trees planted. :) This works for the most part, but there are some special cases (like when the trees are crossed out or when the direction is N/A) that we still need to cover in our function. Next, Alina and I will figure out how to implement a chart to automatically pop up as a visual representation of the data being analyzed. 
                    </p>

                        Tomorrow I will finish debugging the spreadsheet analysis tool with Alina, implement the chart pop ups, and continue with ArcGIS. We also may need to start practicing for next week's presentation.

                        This morning we finished up the decorations and condensed the slides a bit more, then at 11 the open house started. It was fun and interesting to explain the project to community members and we got some interesting insight into potential directions we could take this project! (ex: connecting to sprinkler systems, moisture sensors, etc.)

                        This afternoon we went to meet with Jeanine about ArcGIS about how to use ArcGIS Online to make our shade canopy. I found this tutorial very helpful and it has simplified the ArcGIS Online tool a lot. This afternoon Alina and I also started working on the spreadsheet analysis portion of the project. We talked about what Alina learned in Codeacademy and introduced for-loops and arrays in order to start writing the spreadsheet Analysis tool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next week I plan to continue helping Alina write her spreadsheet analysis tool. I think that after we finish the first tool it will be easier for her to write other tools more independently and with more freedom. I also plan to look more into what Jeanine was talking about with ArcGIS StoryMaps. We have an additional meeting with Brian Hilton from CGU Monday afternoon to discuss ArcGIS Insights, which, although it is part of ArcGIS Pro and not ArcGIS Online, I think will we useful to see what tools are available in ArcGIS Pro in order to keep our options open and in case ArcGIS Online is not sufficient.

                        Today we spent most of the day decorating the office and finishing up the slides. At this point the slides are essentially done, although we might run through them a couple times tomorrow morning before the open house to ensure that our presentation goes smoothly. This morning we also had a meeting with Gabriela from Community Engagement to talk about what to do in case we encounter any uncomfortable situations during the fourth of july event. I feel better prepared with reaching out to a volunteer at the Sustainable Claremont stand if there is an uncomfortable situation.

                        For our office decorations we have gone for a Lorax-drake-texting-trees theme. We've decided to merge with the Texting Analysis group as one team, since our decorations started overlapping. Tomorrow we will finish up preparing for the open house, then the open house will occur at 11am. We also have a meeting with Jeanine at 2pm to talk about ArcGIS.

                        Today I spent most of the day preparing for the open house and working a bit more on the CS Chat slides. This morning I finished preparing the parts of the CS chat slides up to our progress so far. As we continue working, I will continue updating these slides. I also made a copy of the CS Chat slides and changed them up little by condensing and changing the content so it is appropriate for Friday's open house.

                        This morning I finished up our poster for the Sustainable Claremont Fourth of July Booth. I have left it with some bare parts and it is a little sparse in information in case we decide to add graphs later with Alina's spreadsheet analysis functions, or if these functions are not ready for the Fourth of July, we can add a few technical details.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today I also worked on the logo for our messaging tool. Currently I am still between some designs. I am happy with the icon image in the logo and the color of the logo since it matches the website Christina made. Some potential names we have brainstormed for our tool are 'Take Root', or 'TapRoot', or a more technical name like 'Watering Reminder'. For the tagline, we haven’t decided if we want to leave it blank, if we want to have a more fun tagline like 'Watering Trees Made Easy', or if we want a more technical tagline like 'Tree Watering Reminder Tool.' These are all things I will think over a bit more and ask more people for input on before making a final decision. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout the morning and afternoon, after emailing Jeanine a few times back and forth I was able to set up a meeting with Janine for Friday at 2pm in the Digital Resource Center at the library. I am looking forward to learning how to use ArcGIS so that we can get started on the map. (We also got to see Jeanine at the CS chat this morning where we learned about data ethics.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the last half of the afternoon I made some progress on the notes for the CS open house. I now have about 2 pages of notes for the open house, so I may need to spend some time organizing these notes and making them more concise so that we can make a '2 minute elevator pitch' during open house. I also started using these notes to make slides for the CS chat that we will have the week after the fourth of July. I think that putting the notes into slides will help me decide what is important and what can be left out.

                    <p>
                        We also started talking about decorations for our office in preparation for the CS open house. We are thinking of some kind of Lorax theme with Danny Devito incorporated. :) Tomorrow we will probably get started on decorating the office. I am not sure how long this will take, but I am looking forward to this decorating process. I also plan to get more input on the logo I have so far to help decide on what the final design should be.

                        Today I mostly worked on the infographic for the July Fourth Sustainable Claremont stand, but I also got some smaller tasks started this morning. This morning I spent a little while compiling some basic notes about our project's goals, motivations, achievements, next steps, and potential demonstrations in preparation for Friday's CS open house. So far I have about a page of notes, and I plan to polish up these notes tomorrow or whenever I have some downtime this week. I also emailed Jeanine from the library about an ArcGIS tutorial. I got a response right before lunch, and I was able to fill in a few more details about what we will be using ARCGIS for so that Jeanine has a better idea of what tools we will need training for in order to complete our project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I spent the rest of the morning and the whole afternoon working on the poster for the Fourth of July Sustainable Claremont stand. Prof. Medero mentioned that we don't want too much technical information on our poster for this particular event. Instead we want a colorful and eye catching poster that has more easily digestible information so that we can talk to residents about signing up to volunteer to take care of a tree. Right now I feel that the poster is mostly finished.. I still would like to polish it up a bit more and add things to the more bare parts of it. Currently I have 3 sections: one section outlines how much of an effect just one tree can have which broadly covers our tree benefit analysis portion, another section outlines our messaging system which helps residents take care of their trees, and the last section shows residents how to sign up and join the project. Additionally, I still need to get the link for residents to sign up, as well as get the exact numbers of how many trees and how many volunteers we have so far, as I think this is useful information for the poster.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tomorrow I will finish up the notes for Friday's open house, and maybe our team can start brainstorming about how we want to decorate our office for the open house. I also plan to finish up what I can for the fourth of July poster. Though I am not very familiar with the Contact/Messaging portion of the project, I will attempt to help work on the user guide for the Contact/Messaging system. Since we may have additional time at the end of the project if we finish all the tasks we have been assigned, I may look into additional topics that I am interested in exploring. One potential area is Environmental Justice, since this is a field that I am interested in, but I have not explored much This may be a good opportunity to explore this topic, since we have already developed tools examining the quantitative effects of planting trees, so extrapolating this data to connect it to environmental justice could be interesting.

                        Today involved finishing up the default values for the Tree Benefit Analysis tool and taking steps to start working on the newer parts of the project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This morning I was able to implement the default values as Nicole suggested. Where we initially had the default direction as North, we now have a randomly chosen direction if the user doesn't input a direction, which was accomplished through a two line helper function. Where we initially had the default distance as 20'-40', we now have a weighted spread of 0% "0-20ft", 60% "20-40ft", and 30% "40-60ft". Nicole also mentioned that if the tree is located at a park/median, we choose the farthest distance option. I could not find a way to automatically recognize if a tree is in a park or median just based on the address of its location, so instead I updated the drop down menu to have an option for "park or median" so that if the user chooses this option, it corresponds to the furthest distance. I checked with Nicole to see if this seemed like a viable solution, and it seems that she is satisfied with this solution. Regarding the default value for the tree species, in general it seems like the tree species is always filled out for every tree that they plant, so I don't think that a case of unspecified tree species is something we need to worry too much about. Currently, I have left the default tree species as a Crapemyrtle, since it allows for the most conservative estimate, but if this is insufficient we can write some code to get the most common tree on the spreadsheet and use that as the default. At this point, it seems that the coding portion of the Tree Benefit Analysis Tool is complete! :)

                    <p>
                        This morning we also attended the open house for the Engineering Research students which had me starting to think about our open house next week. We spent some time this morning briefly talking about ways we might decorate the office with tree branches or using the budget we have to go to a craft store to find supplies. I also started thinking about the best way to display what we have accomplished so far via posters and/or live demos of our tool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, I also sent out an email to try and set up a Library research tutorial for how to use ARCGIS, but so far there is no response. Hopefully, we will receive a response soon so that we can start using ARCGIS and we can start working on the map portion of the project.

                        This afternoon I started working on the slides for our CS chat the week after July 4th. I anticipate that a lot will change between now and our CS chat in over a week, but for now I think that coming up with background slides and slides about the goals of this project will be productive. I also may start to write about the Contact and messaging tool since it seems to be mostly done. The Tree Benefit Analysis Tool may need a little more polishing, but I think that by Monday or Tuesday I will be able to write about those tools as well. On Monday, I plan to continue working on the slides for the CS chat and maybe think a little bit more about what we are doing for the open house.

                        Today involved polishing up of parts of our project we are almost done with as well as the introduction of some new projects. This morning, after Christina implemented the new system of importing the tree dictionaries from iTree to replace the manually input libraries that we had before, we found that our spreadsheet values matched iTree almost perfectly! So this resolved the big issue from yesterday of the 5% underestimate. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think that the only parts left to complete on the Tree Benefit Analysis portion of this project is to update the default values in the way that Nicole has requested. We previously had a default tree as Crapemyrtle, default direction as North, and default distance as 20'-40', but Nicole has requested that if direction is not specified, we should choose a random direction, and if distance is not specified use 10% "0-20ft", 60% "20-40ft", and 40% "40-60ft". The tree species is almost always specified so we don't really need to worry about it, but we might set it to be whatever the most common tree is in the project. This fix should be very straightforward, so I can implement it first thing tomorrow morning, or if Alina is feeling comfortable with JavaScript, perhaps Alina and I can walk through this fix together!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also spent some time this morning helping Alina fill out her weekly tasks for Upward Bound. There were several parts of her tasks: interviewing a college graduate/student, organization flow of the office, and information about our topic. Hopefully my insight was helpful in some way! Alina seems to be making good progress with Codecademy, so I anticipate that she will be working with us on the code by next week. Some additional tasks that Alina could take part in (if she feels comfortable) is performing spreadsheet analysis. So, for example, she could write some functions exploring how many of each type of tree there is, or how many people prefer to receive their notifications via email compared to via text.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This afternoon we had our meeting with Nicole from Sustainable Claremont, which cleared up some questions that we had and gave us a few new things to work on. We found that the map portion of the project should be a shade canopy study using ARCGIS and not the Google myMaps format that is currently on the website. We may need to schedule a tutorial to learn how to use ARCGIS at the library at some point next week. Nicole also mentioned that it was inconvenient to fill out some portions of the spreadsheet of their volunteers, so we may investigate ways to simplify this process to make it more automatic using the same method we used to retrieve information from iTree and automatically put it into the spreadsheet. We will need to further investigate the source code of the website they are using to see if automatization is possible. We have also planned to launch the messaging system portion of the project in about a week and a half. This timing allows us to troubleshoot if errors pop up for the messages on the Wednesday after the launch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some additional events to plan for were brought up by Prof. Medero. The Fourth of July booth gives up an opportunity to see if our google form is working and to connect to the community. Based on the importance of this July 4th event, we may set up a CS chat the week after July 4th to present our work to the rest of the CS research department. Additionally, we should probably start thinking about how to decorate our office for the CS open house!

                        Most of the morning involved finishing up some work concerning the Individual Benefits code. Originally, the code for Individual Benefits only contained information about CO2 removal and Electricity Savings, but after making some minor changes using the code for Overall Benefits as a reference, the Individual Benefits code now displays information about rainwater and air pollution as well. I also spent some time going through the parts of the code cleaning and commenting some of the changes we made to the existing code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I prepared for tomorrow's meeting by writing down questions to ask Nicole as well as making sure that all the parts of code that we wanted to show her were working as intended. Our main concerns for tomorrow are regarding the maps and the website. Currently on the website there are maps of the trees split up by project, but some of the project maps contain more information than others. At one point Nicole mentioned having maps as part of a shade study, so we may ask for some clarification about what we should construct specifically as part of the shade study for Sustainable Claremont. Depending on the goals of the maps, we may be able to work with Google myMaps to update the current maps. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also found that the dictionary of trees changes depending on the zip code. As a group we decided that it would be most effective to load the tree species and corresponding species codes into the spreadsheet on-install based on the zipcode that the user inputs through the google form. This method seems to be best since we would only need to load in the information once, when the user inputs their information, instead of having to retrieve all of this information where the current tree dictionary is. If we retrieved the information on every call of makeTree, it might be detrimental to the run time. Loading the dictionary of trees into the spreadsheet on-install would also allow us to make the drop down menu of tree species directly. Christina worked on implementing this method throughout the afternoon, and it seems that we are making good progress towards making our analysis tool more generalizable. :) 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout most of the afternoon I looked into where the 5% underestimate error might be coming from. So far there are no conclusive results about pinning down where the problem is coming from. I confirmed that this is not a rounding error since removing the rounding method changes the numbers very slightly but does not account for the consistent 5% underestimate. Since it is an underestimate, I also entertained the possibility that we were running the code one too few years, but I was quickly able to confirm that this is not where the problem was coming from. So, the only other possibility that I can think of is that we are missing some parameter or that some parameter is being input incorrectly. I spent quite some time combing through the source code that we located yesterday, but so far I have not been able to pin down the error yet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tomorrow I will continue to comb through the source code and try to pin down the underestimate error. There is still quite a lot of source code to get through. Tomorrow is also my first time meeting Nicole, and I am looking forward to getting some feedback on what we have accomplished so far as well as seeking some clarification about what to work on next regarding the maps!

                        Today I was able to complete the goals I had set out for myself following yesterday's work regarding Tree Benefit Analysis! :)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This morning was spent mostly examining and testing our progress to make sure we were moving in the right direction. One component that I played around with was the run-time of our code in comparison to the run-time of the code from last year's group. I felt that this was an important area to look into since it was one of last year’s main concerns. Although the run-time is not completely consistent for every time we run the code, it does seem that the changes we have implemented have helped to improve the run time. Sustainable Claremont seems to run the code in chunks of 30 trees for 40 years, so this is what I tested on. Last year's code generally takes anywhere from 100-150 seconds to run this sized chunk of information. Our code generally takes anywhere from 70-120 seconds to run the same amount of information. While this run-time is still not as fast as we would like it to be, it is considerably faster than last year's code on average. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another component that I spent some time working with was the discrepancy between our results and iTree's results. We had some concerns about this discrepancy yesterday, because although our code yesterday matched the outputs of last year's code pretty closely, they did not match the iTree outputs at all. With guidance from Prof. Medero, we first looked into the possibility that there was an error with fetching and parsing data from iTree. We looked into the source code from iTree in the browser and eventually located the relevant information about the url and filling out the tree information. After locating this information, the early afternoon was mostly spent combing through the source code so that we could understand what it was doing and thus make sure that our App Script code was doing what it was supposed to be doing. Upon closer inspection, it did not seem that the error was coming from the fetching and parsing of data from iTree. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From there, I looked more closely at the code from last year. Based on comments and the Protocol for Future Developers, I assumed that certain functions were acting as intended. However, based on the continued errors we were getting, it seemed worthwhile to comb through all the existing code in order to make sure that the code from last year was indeed functioning as intended. As it happens, the code from last year was not functioning as intended. There were quite a few errors with correctly summing the data as well as the placement of variables and for-loops in relation to one another. Through frequent testing and moving different pieces around so that they made more logical sense, I was able to get our outputs to much more closely match iTree's outputs. After making these changes, our outputs are still consistently about 5% lower than iTree's estimate. I will check with Prof. Medero and Nicole to see if this margin of error is acceptable. Our outputs currently do not match last year's output, but they do match iTree's outputs. We have chosen to believe that iTree's outputs are more trustworthy. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today Alina spent much of her time on Codecademy learning Javascript, so while I answered some clarifying questions, for the most part Alina worked independently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tomorrow I will try and pin down where the 5% underestimating error is coming from, since we want the result to be as accurate as possible. My guess is that it is either a rounding error or there is some overlooked parameter that we need to address. Additionally, we have set up a meeting with Nicole for Thursday afternoon, so I plan to spend some time tomorrow preparing for the meeting by trying to see how to best show what we have accomplished so far and updating the list of questions to ask.

                        Today's work was busy, but felt quite fulfilling. This morning started with welcoming our high school intern, Alina, from the Upward Bound program. Alina mentioned that she had no previous experience with computer science, so I was a little bit unsure about how to get her started on the project, since I didn't want it to feel like I was throwing her into the deep-end.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I joined the project, I found that the most useful information for grasping the goals of the project was reading the Protocol for Future Developers written by last year's team, since these documents have information about the different parts of the project organized in a clean way. I spent most of the morning explaining the general goals of this project to Alina as well as conversing with her and trying to better understand her goals for the internship. Based on our conversation about her past internship experience, it seems that having robust background information is something that Alina values, so I felt that reading these protocols and answering her questions about the project was an important first step. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While Alina was reading, I spent my time examining the results from our code and trying to determine where these unreasonable results (discovered last week) were coming from. In the afternoon, I determined that our unreasonable results were coming from an error with indexing the data from the spreadsheet. We made some changes in limiting the range that the code was accessing from the spreadsheet to try and improve run-time, but this meant that the indexing of the tree data was now wrong. After finding and fixing this indexing error, fortunately, now our values pretty closely match the values from last year with some minor discrepancies. Christina made some changes to make the rounding more accurate, so I suspect that these discrepancies come from a difference in rounding as well as iTree's updated tree species list. Upon closer investigation it seems that although our values pretty closely match last year's values, they do not match the values that we are getting from iTree. :( I am not sure if this discrepancy is from user error on our part, or if the values from last year were incorrect. Further research tomorrow may be necessary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to allow Alina to work with the code throughout the internship, I tried to think of the best way to introduce her to our code and Google Apps Script. Since she has no previous computer science experience, I thought it might be best to set up a Codecademy account for her in order to introduce her to Javascript and coding as a whole. However, I was afraid that this might feel too disconnected from our project and feel too much like an independent study in learning computer science instead of an internship. I offered to walk her through some of the code we had written so far, but I am not sure if this was too overwhelming since I know that this is a lot of information to take in for one day. I think that it might be best if I let her gain more familiarity with javascript at her own pace and answer any questions that arise. Then, when she feels that she is ready, I can walk her through our code. I recall feeling slightly overwhelmed with new information on my first day, so I can only imagine that it is overwhelming for her to jump into a new field and a new project. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also got an email from Nicole this afternoon saying that our default values look good, but that she would do further research and let us know if any further changes were needed. Furthermore, we noticed that for Individual Benefits, our code was returning all the same numbers even for different species of trees, but after some testing and online researching, we believe that we have fixed this problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tomorrow, I hope to work more with Alina, and based on what I have learned today I think I will let her learn more at her own pace and offer my support as she needs it so that I am not overwhelming her with too much new and unfamiliar terminology/information. I think tomorrow we will also need to look into the discrepancy between our data and iTree's data. Although our data now matches last year's data, I still feel that this discrepancy is concerning, especially since we are fetching our data directly from iTree, meaning that the data should be the same.

                        Today was spent working on fixing the inconsistencies in the Analysis Tool for Tree Data script. Getting the numbers to be somewhat reasonable took almost all of the workday. The error ended up being that the fetching of data using XML related functions were not correctly included in the loop, so the relevant data for an attribute ended up being summed on top of data from previous attributes, which meant that the first value was correct but the following values were all too large. This error took a while to find since the code has so many different moving parts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By the end of the morning I was able to isolate that the error must be coming from one or two functions. Eventually I was able to catch the error and apply the appropriate fixes. :) I spent a little while checking run time to make sure the changes I had made were not affecting the runtime negatively since this was a major concern from last year’s team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the last part of the workday I applied some changes to the Individual Benefit portion of the code so that the format matches the Overall Benefits to maintain consistency. While this approach did not end up affecting the run time, I think that this makes the code more readable and less densely packed. Instead of having 19 function calls to the same function, there is a function that gathers information for all the attributes so that the function only needs to be called once.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, it felt like I spent a lot of time making not much progress, but I think that in the end we are still taking steps forward, even if they are small steps. During the afternoon, we set up a meeting with Sustainable Claremont in order to discuss the progress we have made so far and to ask clarifying questions. Since this meeting is set for next Tuesday, I decided to spend some time compiling some questions that I wanted to ask Nicole during the meeting. Today I also had the training session for the Upward Bound Mentorship Position. I am looking forward to meeting Alina on Monday! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On Monday I also hope to continue working on this Analysis Tool for Tree Data script, since currently the data being output does not match last year's data. I will compare our current code to the code of last year's group to see if we somehow messed up the looping or the fetching, which would explain the problems we have been having with how the outputs of our current code don't match the outputs from last year's group. Based on how long it took me to catch the error today, I anticipate this process taking a lot of time, effort, and diligent testing. An optimistic hope is that this section of the code will be ready enough to show Nicole our progress by Tuesday.

                        Most of today was spent working on the Individual Tree Benefits code from the Tree Benefits Analysis app script. By the end of the morning I was able to get the code to run without throwing any outstanding errors, which felt like a big step in the right direction! Many of the changes I made had to do with fixing certain for-loops to make sure that the right methods were being looped for the right variables. There were also some errors with variables being in the wrong order when functions were being called, which was causing many errors but were able to be eliminated with a few simple fixes, which is the best type of debugging :). It took some time to pin down these variable errors. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, because of the way that users select rows by clicking and dragging instead of inputting rows in a pop up dialogue, it was necessary to edit some code from last year regarding how the information is being put into the result spreadsheet. This error took a lot of testing and trial & error to fix. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At some point, Google App Script and Google Sheets seemed to malfunction and brought the code back to a version where the changes we had made were somehow reverted, so the code returned to a state of returning many errors which we had previously fixed. It took a little while of restoring yesterday's versions and reimplementing changes in order to get the code back to working the way it had been earlier. This was a bit frustrating and we are still not quite sure what happened with this malfunction or why it happened, but we were able to get the code to its state before the malfunction. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also spent some time this afternoon cleaning up the code by rearranging, reformatting, and adding comments to the areas with the new changes I made so that the code is more human readable. I also ran test cases to make sure that the code is not malfunctioning on some edge cases. There are still some obstacles before this code is fully functional, but it feels like we are making good progress. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tomorrow I plan to examine some of the inconsistencies in the outputs of Calculate Overall Benefits and Calculate Individual Benefits. It seems that some of the changes that Christina and I have introduced may have unintentionally introduced some errors in fetching the data from iTree, since some of the numbers seem either unreasonable or do not match with the data run using last year's code. Fixing these inconsistencies will be tomorrow's main focus. As we continue working on this Tree Benefit Analysis section of the project it may be wise to set up a meeting with Sustainable Claremont just to make sure that our progress is headed in the right direction and to see if there are additional requests they would like us to fulfill.

                        Today started with finishing yesterday's task, which took a bit longer than I had originally anticipated. After checking that our Tree Species list matched the species list on iTree, I found the codes for the newly added trees. With assistance from Prof. Medero, I was able to use Python code from last year to access the species codes of each species' scientific name so that we could put the new codes into the dictionary to match iTree's updates. From this code, I transferred the outputs into a text file. Then from this text file it was easy to look up species and their corresponding codes and update the dictionary. Although I originally anticipated this step taking less than two hours, this process took up the entire morning and the first hour or so after lunch, but now the dictionary should be up to date with iTree. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From there, based on our observation that some trees in the spreadsheet were missing information, default values for a conservative estimate seemed necessary. After some inconclusive online research about what defaults would give us the best conservative estimate, I decided to email Nicole to ask for her input for additional suggestions about what defaults would work best. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I noticed that our code for Overall Benefits was completely not working! Although this section of code was working originally, we decided to make some changes that would make the analyzing tool more user-friendly (selecting rows instead of inputting row numbers). Unfortunately it seems that this design change introduced some errors. I noticed that the Overall Benefit calculation only worked if the user selected the first row as part of the trees they wanted to analyze. Christina and I were able to work together to fix this problem through repeated testing, retracing steps, and trial and error.

                        In the last half hour or so, I continued yesterday's task of trying to fix the code for Individual Benefit Calculations, but was not able to make much progress. I manipulated the variables and loops from Overall Benefit Analysis to work on code for Individual Benefits and hopefully return the individual benefits for each tree over time instead of overall benefits for all trees for each year, but since there is a larger error about xml roots, I was not really able to test my code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tomorrow, I plan to continue working on Individual Analysis. Since I am unfamiliar with XML, it may be necessary to spend some time learning about XML's format and familiarizing myself with the language so that I can understand the error that is popping up about well-formed root elements. Once we get the Individual Benefits part of the tool to work, hopefully we can talk to Sustainable Claremont about what their goals are for the map, as well as generalizing the Tree Benefit Analysis tool so that it can be used in places other than Claremont.

                        Today I finished up yesterday's task of turning the long chunks of if-statements into more concise dictionaries. This was effective in cutting the code from ~1300 lines to ~800 lines in Part II of the Tree Benefit Analysis Script! :)

                        There are two parts of the Tree Benefit Analysis tool. The first is the Overall Benefits which is used for writing grant reports and reports year-by-year and sums across trees. This tool is functional, but quite slow. The second is the Individual Benefits which is used for community engagement and reports tree-by-tree and sums across years. This tool does not work. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The rest of the morning and much of the afternoon was spent trying to get the Individual Tree Benefits results to work. I found that it was difficult for me to work with the original format from last year of having the individual tree benefit results appear in the same document as the original trees. At least temporarily, I will try to get the results to appear in a separate tab similar to how the Overall Benefits results were set up to appear in a separate tab 'Results'. This change was made since the Overall Benefits code results work and I wanted to try and mirror the working code from Overall Benefits to get the non-working code in Individual Benefits to work. Additionally, I had noticed some inconsistencies in variable naming and that similar functions often had the same variables but in different orders, so I spent some time trying to get the code to be more uniform and easier to read.

                    <p>
                        At the end, we noticed that iTree had been updated with different tree names, so some of the information about tree benefits was incorrect, so I began to compare our tree species dictionary with the tree species on iTree. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tomorrow, I will finish updating the tree species and I will look into seeing if it is possible to get the dictionary to update when iTree updates, since it may be cumbersome to have to recheck the tree species dictionary every time iTree updates. Additionally, the code for Individual Tree Species does not consistently work (although it works better than it did this morning) so I hope to put in more time and see what cases it is not working for so we can polish up what last year's group started. Hopefully we will be able to make new developments towards generalizing this code for other organizations!

                        Today was my first day on the Green Crew Research Team! The first hour or so was spent talking to Christina, Reymond, and Prof. Medero about what the team had accomplished in the first couple of weeks and what was left to work on. The rest of the morning and the early part of the afternoon was spent learning about Google App Script by working with a toy example and following online tutorials until I felt relatively comfortable working in the language. From there I read the Protocol for Future Developers documents from the team drive in order to familiarize myself with what had already been accomplished and what still needed work. I decided it would be best for me to start looking at the code for Tree Benefit Analysis as it seemed that much of the work regarding the messaging system was nearly complete (although I spent a little bit of time seeing if we could link the original text to translated messages in case the google translations didn’t make sense, but this did not result in anything concrete). After looking through the notes and the code, it seemed like one of the main problems was run time in gathering data for individual trees. Thus, I tried to comb through the existing code to see if there were any places that run time could be improved. Toward the end of the work day we decided to try turning the ~700 lines of if-statements into a dictionary, so I spent the remainder of the work day beginning to convert these if-statements into a dictionary.

                    <p>
                        Tomorrow I will finish turning the if statements into dictionaries for tree names, distances, and direction as well as making sure my new implementation doesn’t introduce more errors. I plan to also look through more of the code to see if there are other steps that can be taken to improve the runtime so that users don’t have to split the calculation into chunks of rows. There also seemed to be an unresolved error with getting individual tree benefits on a yearly basis.

                This project was a research opportunity at Harvey Mudd working with a local nonprofit (Sustainable Claremont). 
                <br>I worked on a small research team of 3 people (Christina Catlett, Reymon Pedroza, and myself) advised by Professor Julie Medero and mentored a high school student (Alina Zuniga) for 4 weeks during this opportunity.
                <br>We used Google Apps Script to work on a Contact tool to automatically send watering reminders to volunteers based on weather and a Tree Benefit Analysis tool to provide calculations for writing reports. We also used ArcGIS to build a Shade Canopy Map to interactively show tree growth over 25 years.
