                        This morning we finished up the decorations and condensed the slides a bit more, then at 11 the open house started. It was fun and interesting to explain the project to community members and we got some interesting insight into potential directions we could take this project! (ex: connecting to sprinkler systems, moisture sensors, etc.)

                        This afternoon we went to meet with Jeanine about ArcGIS about how to use ArcGIS Online to make our shade canopy. I found this tutorial very helpful and it has simplified the ArcGIS Online tool a lot. This afternoon Alina and I also started working on the spreadsheet analysis portion of the project. We talked about what Alina learned in Codeacademy and introduced for-loops and arrays in order to start writing the spreadsheet Analysis tool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next week I plan to continue helping Alina write her spreadsheet analysis tool. I think that after we finish the first tool it will be easier for her to write other tools more independently and with more freedom. I also plan to look more into what Jeanine was talking about with ArcGIS StoryMaps. We have an additional meeting with Brian Hilton from CGU Monday afternoon to discuss ArcGIS Insights, which, although it is part of ArcGIS Pro and not ArcGIS Online, I think will we useful to see what tools are available in ArcGIS Pro in order to keep our options open and in case ArcGIS Online is not sufficient.

                        Today we spent most of the day decorating the office and finishing up the slides. At this point the slides are essentially done, although we might run through them a couple times tomorrow morning before the open house to ensure that our presentation goes smoothly. This morning we also had a meeting with Gabriela from Community Engagement to talk about what to do in case we encounter any uncomfortable situations during the fourth of july event. I feel better prepared with reaching out to a volunteer at the Sustainable Claremont stand if there is an uncomfortable situation.

                        For our office decorations we have gone for a Lorax-drake-texting-trees theme. We've decided to merge with the Texting Analysis group as one team, since our decorations started overlapping. Tomorrow we will finish up preparing for the open house, then the open house will occur at 11am. We also have a meeting with Jeanine at 2pm to talk about ArcGIS.

                        Today I spent most of the day preparing for the open house and working a bit more on the CS Chat slides. This morning I finished preparing the parts of the CS chat slides up to our progress so far. As we continue working, I will continue updating these slides. I also made a copy of the CS Chat slides and changed them up little by condensing and changing the content so it is appropriate for Friday's open house.

                        This morning I finished up our poster for the Sustainable Claremont Fourth of July Booth. I have left it with some bare parts and it is a little sparse in information in case we decide to add graphs later with Alina's spreadsheet analysis functions, or if these functions are not ready for the Fourth of July, we can add a few technical details.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today I also worked on the logo for our messaging tool. Currently I am still between some designs. I am happy with the icon image in the logo and the color of the logo since it matches the website Christina made. Some potential names we have brainstormed for our tool are 'Take Root', or 'TapRoot', or a more technical name like 'Watering Reminder'. For the tagline, we havenâ€™t decided if we want to leave it blank, if we want to have a more fun tagline like 'Watering Trees Made Easy', or if we want a more technical tagline like 'Tree Watering Reminder Tool.' These are all things I will think over a bit more and ask more people for input on before making a final decision. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout the morning and afternoon, after emailing Jeanine a few times back and forth I was able to set up a meeting with Janine for Friday at 2pm in the Digital Resource Center at the library. I am looking forward to learning how to use ArcGIS so that we can get started on the map. (We also got to see Jeanine at the CS chat this morning where we learned about data ethics.)

                    <p>
                        For the last half of the afternoon I made some progress on the notes for the CS open house. I now have about 2 pages of notes for the open house, so I may need to spend some time organizing these notes and making them more concise so that we can make a '2 minute elevator pitch' during open house. I also started using these notes to make slides for the CS chat that we will have the week after the fourth of July. I think that putting the notes into slides will help me decide what is important and what can be left out.

                    <p>
                        We also started talking about decorations for our office in preparation for the CS open house. We are thinking of some kind of Lorax theme with Danny Devito incorporated. :) Tomorrow we will probably get started on decorating the office. I am not sure how long this will take, but I am looking forward to this decorating process. I also plan to get more input on the logo I have so far to help decide on what the final design should be.

                        Today I mostly worked on the infographic for the July Fourth Sustainable Claremont stand, but I also got some smaller tasks started this morning. This morning I spent a little while compiling some basic notes about our project's goals, motivations, achievements, next steps, and potential demonstrations in preparation for Friday's CS open house. So far I have about a page of notes, and I plan to polish up these notes tomorrow or whenever I have some downtime this week. I also emailed Jeanine from the library about an ArcGIS tutorial. I got a response right before lunch, and I was able to fill in a few more details about what we will be using ARCGIS for so that Jeanine has a better idea of what tools we will need training for in order to complete our project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I spent the rest of the morning and the whole afternoon working on the poster for the Fourth of July Sustainable Claremont stand. Prof. Medero mentioned that we don't want too much technical information on our poster for this particular event. Instead we want a colorful and eye catching poster that has more easily digestible information so that we can talk to residents about signing up to volunteer to take care of a tree. Right now I feel that the poster is mostly finished.. I still would like to polish it up a bit more and add things to the more bare parts of it. Currently I have 3 sections: one section outlines how much of an effect just one tree can have which broadly covers our tree benefit analysis portion, another section outlines our messaging system which helps residents take care of their trees, and the last section shows residents how to sign up and join the project. Additionally, I still need to get the link for residents to sign up, as well as get the exact numbers of how many trees and how many volunteers we have so far, as I think this is useful information for the poster.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tomorrow I will finish up the notes for Friday's open house, and maybe our team can start brainstorming about how we want to decorate our office for the open house. I also plan to finish up what I can for the fourth of July poster. Though I am not very familiar with the Contact/Messaging portion of the project, I will attempt to help work on the user guide for the Contact/Messaging system. Since we may have additional time at the end of the project if we finish all the tasks we have been assigned, I may look into additional topics that I am interested in exploring. One potential area is Environmental Justice, since this is a field that I am interested in, but I have not explored much This may be a good opportunity to explore this topic, since we have already developed tools examining the quantitative effects of planting trees, so extrapolating this data to connect it to environmental justice could be interesting.

                        Today involved finishing up the default values for the Tree Benefit Analysis tool and taking steps to start working on the newer parts of the project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This morning I was able to implement the default values as Nicole suggested. Where we initially had the default direction as North, we now have a randomly chosen direction if the user doesn't input a direction, which was accomplished through a two line helper function. Where we initially had the default distance as 20'-40', we now have a weighted spread of 0% "0-20ft", 60% "20-40ft", and 30% "40-60ft". Nicole also mentioned that if the tree is located at a park/median, we choose the farthest distance option. I could not find a way to automatically recognize if a tree is in a park or median just based on the address of its location, so instead I updated the drop down menu to have an option for "park or median" so that if the user chooses this option, it corresponds to the furthest distance. I checked with Nicole to see if this seemed like a viable solution, and it seems that she is satisfied with this solution. Regarding the default value for the tree species, in general it seems like the tree species is always filled out for every tree that they plant, so I don't think that a case of unspecified tree species is something we need to worry too much about. Currently, I have left the default tree species as a Crapemyrtle, since it allows for the most conservative estimate, but if this is insufficient we can write some code to get the most common tree on the spreadsheet and use that as the default. At this point, it seems that the coding portion of the Tree Benefit Analysis Tool is complete! :)

                    <p>
                        This morning we also attended the open house for the Engineering Research students which had me starting to think about our open house next week. We spent some time this morning briefly talking about ways we might decorate the office with tree branches or using the budget we have to go to a craft store to find supplies. I also started thinking about the best way to display what we have accomplished so far via posters and/or live demos of our tool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, I also sent out an email to try and set up a Library research tutorial for how to use ARCGIS, but so far there is no response. Hopefully, we will receive a response soon so that we can start using ARCGIS and we can start working on the map portion of the project.

                        This afternoon I started working on the slides for our CS chat the week after July 4th. I anticipate that a lot will change between now and our CS chat in over a week, but for now I think that coming up with background slides and slides about the goals of this project will be productive. I also may start to write about the Contact and messaging tool since it seems to be mostly done. The Tree Benefit Analysis Tool may need a little more polishing, but I think that by Monday or Tuesday I will be able to write about those tools as well. On Monday, I plan to continue working on the slides for the CS chat and maybe think a little bit more about what we are doing for the open house.

                        Today involved polishing up of parts of our project we are almost done with as well as the introduction of some new projects. This morning, after Christina implemented the new system of importing the tree dictionaries from iTree to replace the manually input libraries that we had before, we found that our spreadsheet values matched iTree almost perfectly! So this resolved the big issue from yesterday of the 5% underestimate. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think that the only parts left to complete on the Tree Benefit Analysis portion of this project is to update the default values in the way that Nicole has requested. We previously had a default tree as Crapemyrtle, default direction as North, and default distance as 20'-40', but Nicole has requested that if direction is not specified, we should choose a random direction, and if distance is not specified use 10% "0-20ft", 60% "20-40ft", and 40% "40-60ft". The tree species is almost always specified so we don't really need to worry about it, but we might set it to be whatever the most common tree is in the project. This fix should be very straightforward, so I can implement it first thing tomorrow morning, or if Alina is feeling comfortable with JavaScript, perhaps Alina and I can walk through this fix together!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also spent some time this morning helping Alina fill out her weekly tasks for Upward Bound. There were several parts of her tasks: interviewing a college graduate/student, organization flow of the office, and information about our topic. Hopefully my insight was helpful in some way! Alina seems to be making good progress with Codecademy, so I anticipate that she will be working with us on the code by next week. Some additional tasks that Alina could take part in (if she feels comfortable) is performing spreadsheet analysis. So, for example, she could write some functions exploring how many of each type of tree there is, or how many people prefer to receive their notifications via email compared to via text.

                        This afternoon we had our meeting with Nicole from Sustainable Claremont, which cleared up some questions that we had and gave us a few new things to work on. We found that the map portion of the project should be a shade canopy study using ARCGIS and not the Google myMaps format that is currently on the website. We may need to schedule a tutorial to learn how to use ARCGIS at the library at some point next week. Nicole also mentioned that it was inconvenient to fill out some portions of the spreadsheet of their volunteers, so we may investigate ways to simplify this process to make it more automatic using the same method we used to retrieve information from iTree and automatically put it into the spreadsheet. We will need to further investigate the source code of the website they are using to see if automatization is possible. We have also planned to launch the messaging system portion of the project in about a week and a half. This timing allows us to troubleshoot if errors pop up for the messages on the Wednesday after the launch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some additional events to plan for were brought up by Prof. Medero. The Fourth of July booth gives up an opportunity to see if our google form is working and to connect to the community. Based on the importance of this July 4th event, we may set up a CS chat the week after July 4th to present our work to the rest of the CS research department. Additionally, we should probably start thinking about how to decorate our office for the CS open house!

                        Most of the morning involved finishing up some work concerning the Individual Benefits code. Originally, the code for Individual Benefits only contained information about CO2 removal and Electricity Savings, but after making some minor changes using the code for Overall Benefits as a reference, the Individual Benefits code now displays information about rainwater and air pollution as well. I also spent some time going through the parts of the code cleaning and commenting some of the changes we made to the existing code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I prepared for tomorrow's meeting by writing down questions to ask Nicole as well as making sure that all the parts of code that we wanted to show her were working as intended. Our main concerns for tomorrow are regarding the maps and the website. Currently on the website there are maps of the trees split up by project, but some of the project maps contain more information than others. At one point Nicole mentioned having maps as part of a shade study, so we may ask for some clarification about what we should construct specifically as part of the shade study for Sustainable Claremont. Depending on the goals of the maps, we may be able to work with Google myMaps to update the current maps. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also found that the dictionary of trees changes depending on the zip code. As a group we decided that it would be most effective to load the tree species and corresponding species codes into the spreadsheet on-install based on the zipcode that the user inputs through the google form. This method seems to be best since we would only need to load in the information once, when the user inputs their information, instead of having to retrieve all of this information where the current tree dictionary is. If we retrieved the information on every call of makeTree, it might be detrimental to the run time. Loading the dictionary of trees into the spreadsheet on-install would also allow us to make the drop down menu of tree species directly. Christina worked on implementing this method throughout the afternoon, and it seems that we are making good progress towards making our analysis tool more generalizable. :) 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout most of the afternoon I looked into where the 5% underestimate error might be coming from. So far there are no conclusive results about pinning down where the problem is coming from. I confirmed that this is not a rounding error since removing the rounding method changes the numbers very slightly but does not account for the consistent 5% underestimate. Since it is an underestimate, I also entertained the possibility that we were running the code one too few years, but I was quickly able to confirm that this is not where the problem was coming from. So, the only other possibility that I can think of is that we are missing some parameter or that some parameter is being input incorrectly. I spent quite some time combing through the source code that we located yesterday, but so far I have not been able to pin down the error yet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tomorrow I will continue to comb through the source code and try to pin down the underestimate error. There is still quite a lot of source code to get through. Tomorrow is also my first time meeting Nicole, and I am looking forward to getting some feedback on what we have accomplished so far as well as seeking some clarification about what to work on next regarding the maps!

                        Today I was able to complete the goals I had set out for myself following yesterday's work regarding Tree Benefit Analysis! :)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This morning was spent mostly examining and testing our progress to make sure we were moving in the right direction. One component that I played around with was the run-time of our code in comparison to the run-time of the code from last year's group. I felt that this was an important area to look into since it was one of last yearâ€™s main concerns. Although the run-time is not completely consistent for every time we run the code, it does seem that the changes we have implemented have helped to improve the run time. Sustainable Claremont seems to run the code in chunks of 30 trees for 40 years, so this is what I tested on. Last year's code generally takes anywhere from 100-150 seconds to run this sized chunk of information. Our code generally takes anywhere from 70-120 seconds to run the same amount of information. While this run-time is still not as fast as we would like it to be, it is considerably faster than last year's code on average. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another component that I spent some time working with was the discrepancy between our results and iTree's results. We had some concerns about this discrepancy yesterday, because although our code yesterday matched the outputs of last year's code pretty closely, they did not match the iTree outputs at all. With guidance from Prof. Medero, we first looked into the possibility that there was an error with fetching and parsing data from iTree. We looked into the source code from iTree in the browser and eventually located the relevant information about the url and filling out the tree information. After locating this information, the early afternoon was mostly spent combing through the source code so that we could understand what it was doing and thus make sure that our App Script code was doing what it was supposed to be doing. Upon closer inspection, it did not seem that the error was coming from the fetching and parsing of data from iTree. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From there, I looked more closely at the code from last year. Based on comments and the Protocol for Future Developers, I assumed that certain functions were acting as intended. However, based on the continued errors we were getting, it seemed worthwhile to comb through all the existing code in order to make sure that the code from last year was indeed functioning as intended. As it happens, the code from last year was not functioning as intended. There were quite a few errors with correctly summing the data as well as the placement of variables and for-loops in relation to one another. Through frequent testing and moving different pieces around so that they made more logical sense, I was able to get our outputs to much more closely match iTree's outputs. After making these changes, our outputs are still consistently about 5% lower than iTree's estimate. I will check with Prof. Medero and Nicole to see if this margin of error is acceptable. Our outputs currently do not match last year's output, but they do match iTree's outputs. We have chosen to believe that iTree's outputs are more trustworthy. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today Alina spent much of her time on Codecademy learning Javascript, so while I answered some clarifying questions, for the most part Alina worked independently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tomorrow I will try and pin down where the 5% underestimating error is coming from, since we want the result to be as accurate as possible. My guess is that it is either a rounding error or there is some overlooked parameter that we need to address. Additionally, we have set up a meeting with Nicole for Thursday afternoon, so I plan to spend some time tomorrow preparing for the meeting by trying to see how to best show what we have accomplished so far and updating the list of questions to ask.

                        Today's work was busy, but felt quite fulfilling. This morning started with welcoming our high school intern, Alina, from the Upward Bound program. Alina mentioned that she had no previous experience with computer science, so I was a little bit unsure about how to get her started on the project, since I didn't want it to feel like I was throwing her into the deep-end.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I joined the project, I found that the most useful information for grasping the goals of the project was reading the Protocol for Future Developers written by last year's team, since these documents have information about the different parts of the project organized in a clean way. I spent most of the morning explaining the general goals of this project to Alina as well as conversing with her and trying to better understand her goals for the internship. Based on our conversation about her past internship experience, it seems that having robust background information is something that Alina values, so I felt that reading these protocols and answering her questions about the project was an important first step. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While Alina was reading, I spent my time examining the results from our code and trying to determine where these unreasonable results (discovered last week) were coming from. In the afternoon, I determined that our unreasonable results were coming from an error with indexing the data from the spreadsheet. We made some changes in limiting the range that the code was accessing from the spreadsheet to try and improve run-time, but this meant that the indexing of the tree data was now wrong. After finding and fixing this indexing error, fortunately, now our values pretty closely match the values from last year with some minor discrepancies. Christina made some changes to make the rounding more accurate, so I suspect that these discrepancies come from a difference in rounding as well as iTree's updated tree species list. Upon closer investigation it seems that although our values pretty closely match last year's values, they do not match the values that we are getting from iTree. :( I am not sure if this discrepancy is from user error on our part, or if the values from last year were incorrect. Further research tomorrow may be necessary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to allow Alina to work with the code throughout the internship, I tried to think of the best way to introduce her to our code and Google Apps Script. Since she has no previous computer science experience, I thought it might be best to set up a Codecademy account for her in order to introduce her to Javascript and coding as a whole. However, I was afraid that this might feel too disconnected from our project and feel too much like an independent study in learning computer science instead of an internship. I offered to walk her through some of the code we had written so far, but I am not sure if this was too overwhelming since I know that this is a lot of information to take in for one day. I think that it might be best if I let her gain more familiarity with javascript at her own pace and answer any questions that arise. Then, when she feels that she is ready, I can walk her through our code. I recall feeling slightly overwhelmed with new information on my first day, so I can only imagine that it is overwhelming for her to jump into a new field and a new project. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also got an email from Nicole this afternoon saying that our default values look good, but that she would do further research and let us know if any further changes were needed. Furthermore, we noticed that for Individual Benefits, our code was returning all the same numbers even for different species of trees, but after some testing and online researching, we believe that we have fixed this problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tomorrow, I hope to work more with Alina, and based on what I have learned today I think I will let her learn more at her own pace and offer my support as she needs it so that I am not overwhelming her with too much new and unfamiliar terminology/information. I think tomorrow we will also need to look into the discrepancy between our data and iTree's data. Although our data now matches last year's data, I still feel that this discrepancy is concerning, especially since we are fetching our data directly from iTree, meaning that the data should be the same.

                        Today was spent working on fixing the inconsistencies in the Analysis Tool for Tree Data script. Getting the numbers to be somewhat reasonable took almost all of the workday. The error ended up being that the fetching of data using XML related functions were not correctly included in the loop, so the relevant data for an attribute ended up being summed on top of data from previous attributes, which meant that the first value was correct but the following values were all too large. This error took a while to find since the code has so many different moving parts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By the end of the morning I was able to isolate that the error must be coming from one or two functions. Eventually I was able to catch the error and apply the appropriate fixes. :) I spent a little while checking run time to make sure the changes I had made were not affecting the runtime negatively since this was a major concern from last yearâ€™s team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the last part of the workday I applied some changes to the Individual Benefit portion of the code so that the format matches the Overall Benefits to maintain consistency. While this approach did not end up affecting the run time, I think that this makes the code more readable and less densely packed. Instead of having 19 function calls to the same function, there is a function that gathers information for all the attributes so that the function only needs to be called once.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, it felt like I spent a lot of time making not much progress, but I think that in the end we are still taking steps forward, even if they are small steps. During the afternoon, we set up a meeting with Sustainable Claremont in order to discuss the progress we have made so far and to ask clarifying questions. Since this meeting is set for next Tuesday, I decided to spend some time compiling some questions that I wanted to ask Nicole during the meeting. Today I also had the training session for the Upward Bound Mentorship Position. I am looking forward to meeting Alina on Monday! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On Monday I also hope to continue working on this Analysis Tool for Tree Data script, since currently the data being output does not match last year's data. I will compare our current code to the code of last year's group to see if we somehow messed up the looping or the fetching, which would explain the problems we have been having with how the outputs of our current code don't match the outputs from last year's group. Based on how long it took me to catch the error today, I anticipate this process taking a lot of time, effort, and diligent testing. An optimistic hope is that this section of the code will be ready enough to show Nicole our progress by Tuesday.

                        Most of today was spent working on the Individual Tree Benefits code from the Tree Benefits Analysis app script. By the end of the morning I was able to get the code to run without throwing any outstanding errors, which felt like a big step in the right direction! Many of the changes I made had to do with fixing certain for-loops to make sure that the right methods were being looped for the right variables. There were also some errors with variables being in the wrong order when functions were being called, which was causing many errors but were able to be eliminated with a few simple fixes, which is the best type of debugging :). It took some time to pin down these variable errors. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, because of the way that users select rows by clicking and dragging instead of inputting rows in a pop up dialogue, it was necessary to edit some code from last year regarding how the information is being put into the result spreadsheet. This error took a lot of testing and trial & error to fix. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At some point, Google App Script and Google Sheets seemed to malfunction and brought the code back to a version where the changes we had made were somehow reverted, so the code returned to a state of returning many errors which we had previously fixed. It took a little while of restoring yesterday's versions and reimplementing changes in order to get the code back to working the way it had been earlier. This was a bit frustrating and we are still not quite sure what happened with this malfunction or why it happened, but we were able to get the code to its state before the malfunction. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also spent some time this afternoon cleaning up the code by rearranging, reformatting, and adding comments to the areas with the new changes I made so that the code is more human readable. I also ran test cases to make sure that the code is not malfunctioning on some edge cases. There are still some obstacles before this code is fully functional, but it feels like we are making good progress.

                        Tomorrow I plan to examine some of the inconsistencies in the outputs of Calculate Overall Benefits and Calculate Individual Benefits. It seems that some of the changes that Christina and I have introduced may have unintentionally introduced some errors in fetching the data from iTree, since some of the numbers seem either unreasonable or do not match with the data run using last year's code. Fixing these inconsistencies will be tomorrow's main focus. As we continue working on this Tree Benefit Analysis section of the project it may be wise to set up a meeting with Sustainable Claremont just to make sure that our progress is headed in the right direction and to see if there are additional requests they would like us to fulfill.

                        Today started with finishing yesterday's task, which took a bit longer than I had originally anticipated. After checking that our Tree Species list matched the species list on iTree, I found the codes for the newly added trees. With assistance from Prof. Medero, I was able to use Python code from last year to access the species codes of each species' scientific name so that we could put the new codes into the dictionary to match iTree's updates. From this code, I transferred the outputs into a text file. Then from this text file it was easy to look up species and their corresponding codes and update the dictionary. Although I originally anticipated this step taking less than two hours, this process took up the entire morning and the first hour or so after lunch, but now the dictionary should be up to date with iTree. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From there, based on our observation that some trees in the spreadsheet were missing information, default values for a conservative estimate seemed necessary. After some inconclusive online research about what defaults would give us the best conservative estimate, I decided to email Nicole to ask for her input for additional suggestions about what defaults would work best. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I noticed that our code for Overall Benefits was completely not working! Although this section of code was working originally, we decided to make some changes that would make the analyzing tool more user-friendly (selecting rows instead of inputting row numbers). Unfortunately it seems that this design change introduced some errors. I noticed that the Overall Benefit calculation only worked if the user selected the first row as part of the trees they wanted to analyze. Christina and I were able to work together to fix this problem through repeated testing, retracing steps, and trial and error. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the last half hour or so, I continued yesterday's task of trying to fix the code for Individual Benefit Calculations, but was not able to make much progress. I manipulated the variables and loops from Overall Benefit Analysis to work on code for Individual Benefits and hopefully return the individual benefits for each tree over time instead of overall benefits for all trees for each year, but since there is a larger error about xml roots, I was not really able to test my code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tomorrow, I plan to continue working on Individual Analysis. Since I am unfamiliar with XML, it may be necessary to spend some time learning about XML's format and familiarizing myself with the language so that I can understand the error that is popping up about well-formed root elements. Once we get the Individual Benefits part of the tool to work, hopefully we can talk to Sustainable Claremont about what their goals are for the map, as well as generalizing the Tree Benefit Analysis tool so that it can be used in places other than Claremont.

                        Today I finished up yesterday's task of turning the long chunks of if-statements into more concise dictionaries. This was effective in cutting the code from ~1300 lines to ~800 lines in Part II of the Tree Benefit Analysis Script! :)

                        There are two parts of the Tree Benefit Analysis tool. The first is the Overall Benefits which is used for writing grant reports and reports year-by-year and sums across trees. This tool is functional, but quite slow. The second is the Individual Benefits which is used for community engagement and reports tree-by-tree and sums across years. This tool does not work. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The rest of the morning and much of the afternoon was spent trying to get the Individual Tree Benefits results to work. I found that it was difficult for me to work with the original format from last year of having the individual tree benefit results appear in the same document as the original trees. At least temporarily, I will try to get the results to appear in a separate tab similar to how the Overall Benefits results were set up to appear in a separate tab 'Results'. This change was made since the Overall Benefits code results work and I wanted to try and mirror the working code from Overall Benefits to get the non-working code in Individual Benefits to work. Additionally, I had noticed some inconsistencies in variable naming and that similar functions often had the same variables but in different orders, so I spent some time trying to get the code to be more uniform and easier to read. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the end, we noticed that iTree had been updated with different tree names, so some of the information about tree benefits was incorrect, so I began to compare our tree species dictionary with the tree species on iTree. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tomorrow, I will finish updating the tree species and I will look into seeing if it is possible to get the dictionary to update when iTree updates, since it may be cumbersome to have to recheck the tree species dictionary every time iTree updates. Additionally, the code for Individual Tree Species does not consistently work (although it works better than it did this morning) so I hope to put in more time and see what cases it is not working for so we can polish up what last year's group started. Hopefully we will be able to make new developments towards generalizing this code for other organizations!

                        Today was my first day on the Green Crew Research Team! The first hour or so was spent talking to Christina, Reymond, and Prof. Medero about what the team had accomplished in the first couple of weeks and what was left to work on. The rest of the morning and the early part of the afternoon was spent learning about Google App Script by working with a toy example and following online tutorials until I felt relatively comfortable working in the language. From there I read the Protocol for Future Developers documents from the team drive in order to familiarize myself with what had already been accomplished and what still needed work. I decided it would be best for me to start looking at the code for Tree Benefit Analysis as it seemed that much of the work regarding the messaging system was nearly complete (although I spent a little bit of time seeing if we could link the original text to translated messages in case the google translations didnâ€™t make sense, but this did not result in anything concrete). After looking through the notes and the code, it seemed like one of the main problems was run time in gathering data for individual trees. Thus, I tried to comb through the existing code to see if there were any places that run time could be improved. Toward the end of the work day we decided to try turning the ~700 lines of if-statements into a dictionary, so I spent the remainder of the work day beginning to convert these if-statements into a dictionary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tomorrow I will finish turning the if statements into dictionaries for tree names, distances, and direction as well as making sure my new implementation doesnâ€™t introduce more errors. I plan to also look through more of the code to see if there are other steps that can be taken to improve the runtime so that users donâ€™t have to split the calculation into chunks of rows. There also seemed to be an unresolved error with getting individual tree benefits on a yearly basis.

                This project was a research opportunity at Harvey Mudd working with a local nonprofit (Sustainable Claremont). 
                <br>I worked on a small research team of 3 people (Christina Catlett, Reymon Pedroza, and myself) advised by Professor Julie Medero and mentored a high school student (Alina Zuniga) for 4 weeks during this opportunity.
                <br>We used Google Apps Script to work on a Contact tool to automatically send watering reminders to volunteers based on weather and a Tree Benefit Analysis tool to provide calculations for writing reports. We also used ArcGIS to build a Shade Canopy Map to interactively show tree growth over 25 years.
