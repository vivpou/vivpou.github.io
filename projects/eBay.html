                  Our laptops ended arriving early, so we spent a lot of this week setting up our laptops and requesting access to data and software necessary for our project. Additionally, we got started on our literature review. We found a great paper about how Amazon does demand forecasting and looked into Long Short Term Memory models as an improvement from RNN models in terms of making the kinds of predictions we would like. We had a hard time finding how other companies do their predictions since this information is often not shared publicly. In Friday’s liaison meeting, Stephanie and Nathan gave some great advice about new keywords to search and how related problems even in different domains can give insight about the problem we are trying to solve. I think this gives us a great direction to go in for the future of our literature review.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this week’s advisor meeting, Prof. Williams gave us advice on future meetings. We are hoping to have Stephanie come in next Friday so we can meet in person, just in case there are set-up steps that we are still stuck on. Since we cannot go to the eBay office this year, it’ll be nice to see Stephanie in person. :)  We also got some advice on how to structure our 10 hours of work per week to be the most efficient and make the most of our time. Our team decided on a 3 hour work session over zoom together, 3 hours of individual work, and the remaining 4 hours are allocated to our planned meetings. As we dive into the project, we might meet more in our subgroups (of 2 or 3 people) and have less full team and individual meetings. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our liaison meeting this week was very information-heavy but was super helpful in terms of jumping into the project. Stephanie walked us through the tools that would be used for accessing data, writing code, and managing version code. She also showed us some of the preliminary work, which will give us a good starting-off point in terms of starting our own preliminary model(s). Nathan and Stephanie gave advice about how to start with simple data, how to query data, and how we might even reformulate the problem. It seems like our role in the beginning will be pretty exploratory in terms of finding the best approach to this problem. I think it’ll be interesting to learn about the different areas mentioned in the meeting as a team, since we’ll be able to discuss each approach and decide together.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For next week, our team will finish up our onboarding and setup. We will also need to draft our statement of work which I anticipate will be quite time consuming. In the remaining time, we will contribute more the the literature review, do some data exploration, and prepare for next week!

                  Clinic is beginning! For the fall semester, Kyle is our project manager and is already on top of meeting planning. This week we had our first class meeting, first advisor meeting, and first liaison meeting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our class meeting introduced some important clinic figures, discussed best practices, and gave us some general advice on how to have a successful clinic. This was also the first time our student team met as a group, so it was nice to see everyone in person. During our advisor meeting, Prof. Williams gave us some general advice to set up for a successful clinic project. During our liaison meeting, our liaisons gave us a lot of great background about our project, discussed some preliminary work that has been done in this area, and answered a lot of our logistic questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There’s quite a lot of information to take in about clinic, but I’m hopeful that we’ll settle into a schedule and things will feel smoother in weeks to come. For next week, hopefully our laptops will arrive, but in the meantime, we’ll start looking into existing literature and familiarize ourselves with some of the topics that came up in Friday’s meeting.

              This project was for my clinic project for Harvey Mudd’s senior capstone. I worked on a team of five students (Kyle, Yuki, Thomas, Rory, and I), one faculty advisor (Prof. Williams), and liaisons from eBay (Stephanie, Nathan, Xiaolin, Raphael).
              <br>This project aims to make predictive models for on-demand payment so that eBay can better estimate how much money to float so that when sellers withdraw money from their eBay account, the correct amount of funds are available. 
              <br>Our goal is to create a predictive model that is more accurate than the current model that eBay uses.
