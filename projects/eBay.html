                  We were able to finish set-up/tutorials last week which means that this week we were able to start independently using the provided tools and getting a feel for how they fit into our project. For this week, we split into two subteams. Rory and Thomas worked on writing SQL queries and getting used to pulling data tables from eBays datalake to be downloaded for model training. Yuki, Kyle, and I worked on writing some basic baseline models for making predictions based on the previous week’s data. We created baseline models such as using the previous week’s data directly, scaling the previous week’s data, finding the average over the last n days, and using the median of the last week. We calculated and graphed the predictions for these baseline models to try and interpret the results. We found that using the previous week’s data directly and scaling the previous week’s data followed the general data trend with the exception of weeks after banking holidays. We also did some basic data exploration graphing the data directly from the dataset to observe general trendlines. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  During our advisor meeting with Prof. Williams, we presented the work we had done and received feedback about how to present our data and future areas we might consider exploring. Prof. Williams also gave us very helpful insight regarding the metrics we might use to compare our baseline models based on the research we had done so far. She explained why some metrics might not be applicable to our project and which metrics might be a better fit. Lastly, we received more feedback about our statement of work in terms of adding visuals and clarifying deadlines.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this week’s liaison meeting, we showed Stephanie and Nathan the results of our data exploration, baseline models, and SQL queries. We had the opportunity to ask about some inconsistencies we saw in the data and got insights into what could be causing this as well as how to handle these inconsistencies. Regarding our baseline models, Stephanie and Nathan suggested how we might further incorporate metrics so that each model could be directly, quantitatively compared to one another. We also received advice on how to more clearly visualize our results. Finally, we received advice on how to navigate the datalake in order to get access to the necessary data. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  For next week, we will apply Stephanie and Nathan’s advice on adding metrics for comparison and metric visualizations to our existing baseline models. We will also refactor our existing code to allow for easier collaboration and a more efficient workflow. Lastly, our statement of work draft is due on Monday, so we will work as a team on completing and turning in the draft.

                  This week we spent most of our time doing individual work of working on sections of our Statement of Work and going through the tools for data exploration. We split up the sections of the Statement of Work on Sunday and worked on it throughout the week. I was tasked with the introduction, where I gave a high-level overview of eBay’s functions, the parts of their payment transactions, and how this connects to the problem we are trying to solve. Yuki and Kyle added sources to our literature review as a part of their work on our approaches. Lastly, we each spent a few hours going through eBay’s provided tutorial videos for the capabilities. This tool will allow us to write SQL queries to access parts of eBay’s datalake so that we can use it for our models.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this week’s advisor meeting, we went over our statement of work with Prof. Williams and got some feedback on what to change, specifically focusing on our deadlines. We also talked through the logistics for Stephanie’s in-person meeting next week. In this week’s liaison meeting, we received additional feedback on our statement of work, specifically surrounding metrics for scoring our models, adding a bit about exploratory data analysis, and the importance of failing often in the iterative process while documenting those failures. We talked through some additional insights on our literature review to get guidance on what direction to go in for this upcoming week. In the last half of the meeting, Priya walked us through a dashboard that eBay uses for data visualization. This was really informative in terms of gaining insights and being able to see the data patterns more easily. The dashboard had a lot information so I anticipate that as we get to know the data better we will be able to leverage the dashboard better and understand the insights it is providing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We are hoping Stephanie will be able to visit Mudd’s campus next Friday. Between now and the next meeting, we plan to start understanding the data flow, in terms of writing SQL queries to download data, as well as starting with some very baseline models to understand the tools being used and the basics of importing data. Lastly, we will continue to work on the Statement of Work and the literature review document.

                  Our laptops ended arriving early, so we spent a lot of this week setting up our laptops and requesting access to data and software necessary for our project. Additionally, we got started on our literature review. We found a great paper about how Amazon does demand forecasting and looked into Long Short Term Memory models as an improvement from RNN models in terms of making the kinds of predictions we would like. We had a hard time finding how other companies do their predictions since this information is often not shared publicly. In Friday’s liaison meeting, Stephanie and Nathan gave some great advice about new keywords to search and how related problems even in different domains can give insight about the problem we are trying to solve. I think this gives us a great direction to go in for the future of our literature review.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this week’s advisor meeting, Prof. Williams gave us advice on future meetings. We are hoping to have Stephanie come in next Friday so we can meet in person, just in case there are set-up steps that we are still stuck on. Since we cannot go to the eBay office this year, it’ll be nice to see Stephanie in person. :)  We also got some advice on how to structure our 10 hours of work per week to be the most efficient and make the most of our time. Our team decided on a 3 hour work session over zoom together, 3 hours of individual work, and the remaining 4 hours are allocated to our planned meetings. As we dive into the project, we might meet more in our subgroups (of 2 or 3 people) and have less full team and individual meetings. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our liaison meeting this week was very information-heavy but was super helpful in terms of jumping into the project. Stephanie walked us through the tools that would be used for accessing data, writing code, and managing version code. She also showed us some of the preliminary work, which will give us a good starting-off point in terms of starting our own preliminary model(s). Nathan and Stephanie gave advice about how to start with simple data, how to query data, and how we might even reformulate the problem. It seems like our role in the beginning will be pretty exploratory in terms of finding the best approach to this problem. I think it’ll be interesting to learn about the different areas mentioned in the meeting as a team, since we’ll be able to discuss each approach and decide together.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For next week, our team will finish up our onboarding and setup. We will also need to draft our statement of work which I anticipate will be quite time consuming. In the remaining time, we will contribute more the the literature review, do some data exploration, and prepare for next week!

                  Clinic is beginning! For the fall semester, Kyle is our project manager and is already on top of meeting planning. This week we had our first class meeting, first advisor meeting, and first liaison meeting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our class meeting introduced some important clinic figures, discussed best practices, and gave us some general advice on how to have a successful clinic. This was also the first time our student team met as a group, so it was nice to see everyone in person. During our advisor meeting, Prof. Williams gave us some general advice to set up for a successful clinic project. During our liaison meeting, our liaisons gave us a lot of great background about our project, discussed some preliminary work that has been done in this area, and answered a lot of our logistic questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There’s quite a lot of information to take in about clinic, but I’m hopeful that we’ll settle into a schedule and things will feel smoother in weeks to come. For next week, hopefully our laptops will arrive, but in the meantime, we’ll start looking into existing literature and familiarize ourselves with some of the topics that came up in Friday’s meeting.

              This project was for my clinic project for Harvey Mudd’s senior capstone. I worked on a team of five students (Kyle, Yuki, Thomas, Rory, and I), one faculty advisor (Prof. Williams), and liaisons from eBay (Stephanie, Nathan, Xiaolin, Raphael).
              <br>This project aims to make predictive models for on-demand payment so that eBay can better estimate how much money to float so that when sellers withdraw money from their eBay account, the correct amount of funds are available. 
              <br>Our goal is to create a predictive model that is more accurate than the current model that eBay uses.
